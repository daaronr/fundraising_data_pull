<p>Climate change poses the biggest threat to the future of our planet. Global temperatures have been rising for over a century and are now the highest on record. One landscape the climate crisis has put into meltdown is the Arctic, with this polar region warming almost three times faster than the global average. It may seem a bit chilly for some of us, but the Arctic is crucial for lots of reasons. </p>

<p>Polar bears and walrus call this freezing landscape their home. But their environment is changing, because of global warming. The sea ice during the summer months is declining, and with global warming, that ice is shrinking fast.</p>

He is now 3 years old and the happiest, cheekiest, most affectionate little boy who I absolutely adore! My journey into motherhood didn’t start as planned, the world decided to have a pandemic and well goodbye to social groups and having the most fun with Leo and our friends and family. Coming out of lockdown I knew Leo wasn’t hitting all his “milestones”, he doesn’t clap, point, wave, he struggles with eye contact and is non-verbal, but of course at the time as any parent does I made every excuse under the sun. Until it came to Leo’s second birthday, I couldn’t keep hiding what I knew was coming, I needed to speak up. From September 2021 we have been on the journey of Leo being diagnosed with Autism. </span><span> It has been a rollercoaster of a journey, so many appointments, so many observations, it isn’t just a one day, one person diagnosis. It is ALOT and it can be lonely. Autism isn’t something I knew much about and my god am I still learning, but to explain it to people of why Leo is the way he is sometimes is hard. But along this journey I have had amazing support, I have made some lifelong friends who are in the same position and it has been nice to finally be able to turn to another parent on this journey. Part of that is down to Barnados. The support they have given to us and the parent support class we attended was honestly amazing, the time, effort and care they put in I couldn’t be more grateful and so this is my way of just saying thank you for all the hard work they do for children and families not just in our situation but just in general life with how the world is currently. I really couldn’t thank them enough for their love and support.

He is now 3 years old and the happiest, cheekiest, most affectionate little boy who I absolutely adore! My journey into motherhood didn’t start as planned, the world decided to have a pandemic and well goodbye to social groups and having the most fun with Leo and our friends and family. Coming out of lockdown I knew Leo wasn’t hitting all his “milestones”, he doesn’t clap, point, wave, make eye contact and is non-verbal, but of course at the time as any parent does I made every excuse under the sun. Until it came to Leo’s second birthday, I couldn’t keep hiding what I knew was coming, I needed to speak up. From September 2021 we have been on the journey of Leo being diagnosed as Autistic. It has been a rollercoaster of a journey, so many appointments, so many observations, it isn’t just a one day, one person diagnosis. It is ALOT and it can be lonely. Autism isn’t something I knew much about and my god am I still learning, but to explain it to people of why Leo is the way he is sometimes is hard. But along this journey I have had amazing support, I have made some lifelong friends who are in the same position and it has been nice to finally be able to turn to another parent on this journey. Part of that is down to Barnados. The support they have given to us and the parent support class we attended was honestly amazing, the time, effort and care they put in I couldn’t be more grateful and so this is my way of just saying thank you for all the hard work they do for children and families not just in our situation but just in general life with how the world is currently. I really couldn’t thank them enough for their love and support. So here I am taking myself out of my comfort zone, into the unknown and on a rollercoaster of a journey, something Leo and lots of other children deal with everyday.</span><span> </span></p><p class=""p3"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><span class=""s2""></span></p><p class=""p3"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><span class=""s2"">Any donation amount you can spare will be really appreciated by myself and the charity who do so much to support children and families.

Can you imagine how tough life can be when a military career comes to an end, especially if it has been cut short by illness or injury. Overnight, you lose not only your job, but also a support network that is like family. 

This is why I stand with Help for Heroes.

There are many ways the Charity helps veterans, their loved ones, serving personnel, and people who worked alongside the UK military. From helping people with their physical and mental health. To giving people the support, skills, confidence, and knowledge to make a success of life in the civilian world.  

Its an injustice that people dont get a fair deal from the country they risked everything for. Help for Heroes wont stop until those who served to keep us safe get the support they deserve.

My ankle was displaced and had to be reset which took two very painful attempts</span><span class=""s4"">.
