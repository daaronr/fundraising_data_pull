<p>Climate change poses the biggest threat to the future of our planet. Global temperatures have been rising for over a century and are now the highest on record. One landscape the climate crisis has put into meltdown is the Arctic, with this polar region warming almost three times faster than the global average. It may seem a bit chilly for some of us, but the Arctic is crucial for lots of reasons. </p>

<p>Polar bears and walrus call this freezing landscape their home. But their environment is changing, because of global warming. The sea ice during the summer months is declining, and with global warming, that ice is shrinking fast.</p>

<p>By sponsoring me to Brave the Chill, together we can help bring our world back to life.</p>","Jim's page54321","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"b6bd09de-f07e-45fd-bca1-4ee98307ba22",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Can you imagine how tough life can be when a military career comes to an end, especially if it has been cut short by illness or injury. Overnight, you lose not only your job, but also a support network that is like family. 

This is why I stand with Help for Heroes.

There are many ways the Charity helps veterans, their loved ones, serving personnel, and people who worked alongside the UK military. From helping people with their physical and mental health. To giving people the support, skills, confidence, and knowledge to make a success of life in the civilian world.  

Its an injustice that people dont get a fair deal from the country they risked everything for. Help for Heroes wont stop until those who served to keep us safe get the support they deserve.

I did the maths and worked out that 5 million steps in a year was an achievable target but also a stretch. There are days when circumstances just do not allow<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></span><span class=""s4"">too many steps</span><span class=""s4"">. I also wanted to raise some money for a good cause. Knowing a few people who have been affected by Alzheimer’s Disease I think there is no more a worthy cause. So off I set…….</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><span class=""s4"">Come Easter Bank Holiday month, I had lost two stone in weight and was ahead of target having walked over 1.9 million steps, I was really enjoying the challenge, and a weekend at our caravan always afforded nice walks. The day started, as it has done many times with a walk around the sea wall with our dog, Rocco</span><span class=""s4"">…except I didn’t make it back to the caravan</span><span class=""s4"">. I stepped off a shallow ledge straight into a pothole covered by the overgrown grass, I felt my ankle rotate underneath me, and although I didn’t hear a snap, I knew immediately it was broken, within a couple of minutes I also had excruciating pain on the outside of my lower leg.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><span class=""s4"">After a couple of hours, I was in a splint and carted off to hospital by ambulance. Looking at the X Rays, I heard the radiographer<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></span><span class=""s4"">say,</span><span class=""s4""><span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span>‘it’s pretty messed up down there’, this was soon after validated when the consultant told me I had a broken tibia, broken fibula</span><span class=""s4"">,</span><span class=""s4""><span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span>and a ruptured deltoid ligament. My ankle was displaced and had to be reset which took two very painful attempts</span><span class=""s4"">. I was booked in for ORIF surgery 9 days later to allow the swelling to subside.</span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><span class=""s4"">I was laid up for over 7 weeks non weight bearing, I had plenty of time to recalculate how much the average step count was increasing if I was to cover 5 million steps and confess that as time went on, I thought it would be unachievable……</span><span class=""s4"">but</span><span class=""s4""><span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span>I am</span><span class=""s4""><span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span>nothing but</span><span class=""s4""><span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span>determined</span><span class=""s4"">.</span><span class=""s4""><span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span>I also had time to research how I could give myself the best chance.

I am not quite walking full pace or full stride and develop a slight limp after around 5,000 steps</span><span class=""s4"">, I also have Plantar Fasciitis and have been told that my ankle will never be normal.
