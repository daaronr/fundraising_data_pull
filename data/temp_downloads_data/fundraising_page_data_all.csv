This winter may be our toughest yet and I am helping to bring some community spirit by sharing my sparkle by supporting St John. 

St John volunteers treat and transport thousands of patients each year, and in times of crisis we are England's national health reserve.  

During the pandemic our skilled and highly trained volunteers are working long shifts supporting sick people and their families, in hospitals, in ambulances and at home. We are proud to be working alongside the nations ambulance trusts and in hospitals around the country.

""I enjoy helping people and its what I have been training to do. Its very rewarding personally knowing that my colleagues and I are making a difference to peoples lives when they most need it."" 
Tom Willis, volunteer

My Grandpa had a Heart Attack in Front Of My Grandma and it was a real shock to us all as she was the one who was already very sick with Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and mobility problems. I am doing this for their memory, my Grandpa gave his all to Love her, taking her out of the home she was in because they were always so very much in love. I like to think that they know I am doing it for them and hope to make them proud even though we have now lost them both. I believe my Grandma died 6 months later from a broken heart &#128148; She even told her Carers, the day she died that Jack had come for her! It was just the sort of thing he would have done for her, anything and everything.

Out of the blue she’d had a seizure, which we learned later had been caused by an aggressive brain tumour, and she died just 18 days later. Mum had just turned 60, had retired a week before her diagnosis and she and dad had been planning to travel the world. It was a devastating shock for all who loved her. When we were told that she had weeks to live, her response was </span><span style=""color: #222222;background-color: transparent;""><i>‘it is what it is’</i></span><span style=""color: #222222;background-color: transparent;"">, and her strength has carried me through the months since and inspired me to live with the same courage that she taught me. </span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""color: #222222;background-color: transparent;"">I want to do something positive in her memory so, myself and my partner, Lauren, are going to walk the Jurassic Coast to raise money for a charity close to both of our hearts: Cancer Research UK.</span><span style=""color: #ff0000;background-color: transparent;""> </span><span style=""color: #222222;background-color: transparent;"">To be able to raise vital funds for research and to support this incredible charity, which has been struggling through the pandemic, would be truly heartening to us. Lauren, who will be walking alongside and fundraising with me to reach our target, also sadly lost her father to a brain tumor. Together we are determined to try to make a difference. </span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""color: #222222;background-color: transparent;"">Our route for our challenge is from Exmouth in Devon to Swanage in Dorset, and we will don our walking boots from the 13</span><span style=""color: #222222;background-color: transparent;""><span>th</span></span><span style=""color: #222222;background-color: transparent;""> to the 19</span><span style=""color: #222222;background-color: transparent;""><span>th</span></span><span style=""color: #222222;background-color: transparent;""> of March 2021. Lauren and I are organising this sponsored trek on our own, just us, our backpacks and several packed lunches. The length of this walk is just over 100 miles and with our goal to complete the walk in 7 days we will be covering as many as 20 miles a day, come rain or shine. This is guaranteed to be a shock in comparison to the 100 daily steps we are currently taking during lockdown … from the sofa to the fridge, and back again – but we’re determined to succeed.</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""color: #222222;background-color: transparent;"">We understand how tough a time this is to encourage charitable donations, but Cancer Research UK has experienced a huge drop in funding during this time and their work has been slowed by the impact of Covid-19. It would mean so much to us to be able to contribute to what this great organisation does. Any donation, big or small, or even a share of this page, will help.

The Hospice is often very different from what people expect  it is a warm, friendly space with beautiful gardens, delicious home-cooked food and personalised care. Every person is treated as an individual and helped to reach their goals and fulfil their wishes. A team of nurses, doctors, social workers, physiotherapists, chaplains, bereavement counsellors and pharmacists work together, putting every person at the centre of their care.  Throughout Covid-19 Bradford Hospice teams have been working around the clock to continue supporting local people. Death, dying and bereavement is at the forefront of peoples minds and Marie Curie knows what a difference the right care at the end of life can make.   They cant do any of this without your support. Thank you for your generous donation which supports the Bradford Hospice and Marie Curie care.</p><p>My mother was treated with respect, care and love and her symptoms were well controlled while cared for in the Bradford Hospice.  At present, due to the Covid restrictions, it is very difficult for the Hospice to raise vital money to maintain essential services.  Any contributions will make a difference.  Thank you..</p>","liz's page","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,"829811","Ruby Wood","/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/13667693","remember/829811","https://images.justgiving.com/image/6e09a671-01c2-4140-a590-a1195e46ef83.jpg","https://images.justgiving.com/image/6e09a671-01c2-4140-a590-a1195e46ef83.jpg?template=size150x150face",NA,NA,"0b7488b8-cf0a-4f28-81f7-e6520ece1445",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Horrific. Yet, insanely, it gets very little attention in the media despite it being one of the worst humanitarian crises in recent memory.</p><p><span>After five years of conflict, most of the population in Yemen needs humanitarian assistance. They have a lack of basic healthcare, severe food shortages and limited clean water.  CARE is focused on helping the most vulnerable people, through distributing food to families in need, and cash vouchers so that families can purchase for themselves the food they need.Over a year of fighting and fuel shortages has destroyed water pipes and water pumping facilities, so CARE is rehabilitating water sources and providing water tanks so women and children can get safe drinking water without having to travel long distances.CARE is also providing hygiene kits, paying special attention to womens and children's needs.Thank you for reading.
