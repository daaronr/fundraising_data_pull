It was so appreciated as I could get some good rest and ensure I was in the best place for looking after her the following days, it also meant she could die at home where she wanted to be with me by her side Instead of going into a hospice. I really can’t expressed how valuable this service is and how important it is to families.

I did not ask for a fee for these talks but simply my expenses to be reimbursed.  Now we are doing everything online, so I have adapted my 'live' presentations to be delivered online using services such as Zoom. So for winter 20/21 I have decided that I will ask clubs to make a donation to WaterAid if they have enjoyed my talk.  <br/>Thank you if you are making a donation. </span><br/></p>","Jay's Inside My Head - photography online presentations","0","0","0","0","0","I am giving online talks to camera clubs because water is a basic need in life.
