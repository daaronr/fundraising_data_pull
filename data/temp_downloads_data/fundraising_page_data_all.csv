Living with cancer can be devastating at the best of times, but even harder as a result of the recent pandemic.  At Macmillan, we talk to people affected by cancer every day and for many, issues with money and mental health such as stress and depression, are their biggest worry.

Our partnership focuses on tackling financial hardship and loneliness together, helping Macmillan develop their telephone, online and virtual support services and to help thousands more people with much needed financial and emotional support.

The CBRE partnership is going to be more important than ever before, to help Macmillan do whatever it takes to support every single person living with cancer.

Cancer is not going anywhere.  And neither can Macmillan.

I was given advice to tell my story on my page, well I can't do that because this is really a story that has affected so many people. Probably most of the people I know have been affected by cancer in some way or other. If we haven't lost someone personally or know of someone who has, then it's the sort of silent fear that lurks if we spent too much time in the sun as kids, ate burnt toast or had a parent who had a genetic form of the disease. The NHS are wonderful, and the nurses and doctors who treat cancer patients are saints, and it feels like charities such as Macmillan play an equally important role, in support, advice and care.</p><p>So I'm walking 13 miles in the beautiful Lake District to raise money. The longest walk I have ever been on is 9 miles, which took all day, so training starts here... eeek! Thank you so much for any donations you can make, every pound really helps! The Macmillan Mighty Hike target is £250.00, but I have decided to go for £300.00 as it is totally worth it!</p>","Lindy's Mighty Hike for Macmillan","2.50","0","10","3","0",NA,"852443","Anne Wildman","/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/13910404","remember/852443",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Your small steps will help Guide Dogs make giant leaps. Just one week of stepping can make a difference to the life of children and adults living with sight loss. Raise over £50 (£25 for children) and well replace those worn out socks with a brand-new Guide Dogs pair designed by an international fashion icon!

How your funds will change lives...

-	£50 could pay for fun, tactile activities to help children co-ordinate their muscles and movements.

-	£96 could pay for an eye test each for two guide dogs in training

-	£116 could buy a Training School Kit for one of our guide dog trainers who will teach pups the specialist skills they need as fully qualified guide dogs.

-	£710 could buy a Birthing Kit containing all the essential equipment for a guide dog mum to safely deliver her puppies.

Its thanks to people like you that we can continue to provide life-changing services. So, a huge thank you and lots of luck for your challenge!
