We have decided to do this</span>  <span>once</span>  <span>in a lifetime opportunity, to physically and mentally challenge ourselves while raising money and awareness for the charity, Marie Curie, which is very close to our hearts. We are flying from London to Kathmandu, Nepal’s vibrant capital, where we will then fly to Lukla on a twin engined plane. From here we will start our trek into the heart of the Nepali Himalaya, we will trek for 11 days, for several hours each day, through the Himalayan peaks reaching a significant altitude (5,545m above sea level)</span>  <span>eventually reaching</span>  <span>Everest Base Camp. We will be documenting our whole training journey and our trek, to take you along with us. </span></p><p><span>Cancer is something which has affected the majority of us, whether through our own suffering or seeing a loved one suffer. By 2040, the number of new cancer cases per year is expected to rise to 29.5 million and the number of cancer-related deaths to 16.4 million, which are figures unbearable to think about. I think you can all agree with us that cancer is the most cruel and unbearable disease for both those suffering and those watching others suffer. It has taken away many of our loved ones when it simply wasn’t time for them to go. </span></p><p><span>We will be grateful for any support you can give us, even if you can only spare a pound. We are hoping over the next 12 months to achieve a target of £6,000 for the amazing charity Marie Curie who support those that are living with a terminal illness daily. They are there through all aspects of dying, death and bereavement – and to fight for a society where everyone gets to lead the best life they can, right to the end. We understand this is a very difficult time for many , especially with the global pandemic we are all experiencing. Even if you can’t spare any money we would love you to support and come along on this adventure with us. </span></p><p><span>Many thanks, </span></p><p>Ross &amp; Beth x </p>"," Ross & Beth- Everest Base Camp - Swansea University","37.50","0","415","7","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Beth Jones & Ross Boast",NA,NA,NA,"04a8fc6d-31e6-40ed-be7d-7a19829d17ea","SWANEBC"
