She has been so helpful and caring and gone above and beyond and Chez absolutely adored her.

They showed us how he had 5 heart attacks over the past 2 weeks with the technology available - without fundraising this technology wouldn't be around. </p><p style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);color: rgb(38, 38, 38);"">A week of testing diagnosed 3 blocked main arteries to his heart. We're not too sure how long he has been living with j<span>ust 2 arteries but his body was slowly giving up. Stents were not an option as the arteries were pretty much dead. After being told there was nothing Kettering general was able to do for him the wait started for a bed over at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester. 2 weeks later we received the call to say the bed was free and an ambulance was on route to take him. </span></p><p style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);color: rgb(38, 38, 38);""><span>Over at Glenfield they detailed the operation he needed. Open heart surgery of a triple heart bypass. Despite everyone telling you how routine these operations are the worry we faced as a family was nothing short of horrendous.  Luckily our wait was less than a week and dad was off for his 5 hour operation. </span><br/></p><p style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);color: rgb(38, 38, 38);""><span>The longest day of our lives fell on Valentines day 2020 - but that evening we </span>received<span> the news the Op had gone well and he was in ICU recovering. 2 days later we went to visit and it was heartbreaking to see my dad suffering the effects of open heart surgery. However classic dad had us all laughing and joking within no time - 4 days post op he was up walking and just short of a week after surgery he was ready to come home. </span></p><p style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);color: rgb(38, 38, 38);""><span>The frail old guy in these photos is what we brought home with us - the guy who was the man of the house unable to even walk unaided but the support my mum has given him over the past 8 months  - we have our dad back! He is even growing a little belly now too. He has been so spoiled by her! </span></p><p style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);color: rgb(38, 38, 38);""><span>Before this year I could literally run when playing rugby - and this wasn't a lot.

I am a musician from Cornwall.<br/><br/>I have been playing online gigs since March when the music scene started to close down. I am a gigging musician who, like many others, have been unable to work. I began on the day that we lost Kenny Rogers and I played some of his songs to anyone that wanted to listen via a Facebook live stream. This spiralled out of control and now, unbelievably, I am approaching my 100th show all this time on. The show will take place on Friday 30th October.<br/><br/>The 50th show was a great event for me which attracted a whole pile of views mostly because of local radio exposure and the fans that I have amassed during the course of the shows. I never for a moment imagined that I would make it to 50 shows let alone 100. I am trying to get the 100th show to be even bigger.<span> </span><br/><br/>I will be raising money for ‘Help Musicians’ and for ‘Cancer Research’ charities that both have a significant meaning to me and my family.<br/><br/>Thank you in advance for any donations you give.</p><p style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245);"">You can watch the show on my Facebook page on Friday 30th of October at 7pm UK time.</p><p style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245);"">Www.facebook.com/helm.devegas</p><p style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245);"">Thanks for caring.</p><!--EndFragment--><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>","Helm's Live Stream - The One Hundred Shows Of Helm","0","0","0","0","0","https://images.justgiving.com/image/f3b01628-589a-4438-91ba-661bfae4680a.jpg","https://images.justgiving.com/image/f3b01628-589a-4438-91ba-661bfae4680a.jpg?template=size150x150face",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I'm Alexandria and I'll be freezing my arse off for charity! It might sound crazy, but hear me out. I received an email from the WWF telling me how since 1970, wildlife populations have gone down by an average of 68%. After stamping on my heart, they told me that luckily I could do something to help called the Big Winter Wander! Basically, on the 24th of January next year I'll be walking 20km in the Kirkhill Forest, to hopefully raise £100 for the WWF. </p><p>I think we could all agree that in recent times (due to a certain virus), nature has been something we've grown to appreciate more. For some of us, a walk outside might be one of the only things to bring peace and leave us feeling positive in a time so scary. I have personally found joy in spotting creatures local to our home Scotland, like the red squirrel, robins and even badgers! But if we don't try to change the course of our impact on the environment and the world we live in, we might not have the privilege of getting into nature one day, or the chance to point out all of these amazing little creatures to our friends, family, or even our own children. Scotland and its local nature is something I love and care about so much, and the thought of it suffering or eventually disappearing is deeply upsetting. </p><p>So that's why I'll be doing this walk. I'm doing it for our future. I would be so grateful for any support, in the form of a donation, or company on my walk. My family will be joining me, and there is plenty of room for friends too. I'm hoping to point out some particularly interesting pieces of nature, and make it a fun walk for everyone. Message me if you're interested! if you decide to donate, thank you so much. It really does make a difference. </p>","Alexandria's Big Winter Wander","65","0","290","290","0","https://images.justgiving.com/image/4641d819-5101-445a-ba62-83c5f9f514c7.jpg","https://images.justgiving.com/image/4641d819-5101-445a-ba62-83c5f9f514c7.jpg?template=size150x150face",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"I am walking 20km because I love Scotland's nature, and I want it to stay","I am walking 20km","I love Scotland's nature, and I want it to stay",NA,NA,"f4d94847-4932-45a1-bcdc-32d8bc497a7e",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

You might notice theres less wildlife than there used to be. Thats because half of all UK species are in decline were losing our precious red squirrels, hedgehogs and birds at an alarming rate. By taking part in The Big Winter Wander, you and your friends and family can reconnect with our country's beautiful wildlife and help protect it. The funds you raise will help us campaign to protect wildlife here, and around the world. Nature has been there to offer us comfort during difficult times, and now its our time to give back.</p>","Jez","0","0","0","0","0","https://images.justgiving.com/image/545ed20d-3cbe-4d39-9934-d856ab3ade53.jpg","https://images.justgiving.com/image/545ed20d-3cbe-4d39-9934-d856ab3ade53.jpg?template=size150x150face",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"f4d94847-4932-45a1-bcdc-32d8bc497a7e",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
