Our problem is (like so many other people) we always need a kick to keep us going. We are currently coming to the end of a 4 week challenge, and came across an advert for Macmillan’s 40 days of fitness, which got me thinking...</p><p>Like so many other people we know (too many) people who have had to fight this vile disease, some successfully and sadly some not. </p><p>Charities like Macmillan do absolutely amazing jobs not only supporting the individuals, but their families. They not only offer support towards treatment, but support in all areas of life for those who are ill and their families. </p><p>As with so many other charities during this past year, they have continued their (unsung) support to those who have needed it, with ever dwindling funds. Due to this pandemic, they have not been able to carry out their usual fundraising events to raise the desperately needed funding. </p><p>So, we thought if We are going to be doing this getting fit thing, what better kick and encouragement than to collect some money to donate to this wonderful cause. We know money is tight for so many people at the moment, which is why we have only set a target of £50 to raise. But if you could donate 50p towards this cause, we will be deeply grateful to you.</p><p>So, starting on the 1st January 2021 We’ll be doing a minimum of 30 minutes of activity everyday for 40 days. I’ll track it on my watch, Beth on her fitbit and we will post photos on our FB/Instagram stories so you can check up on us! </p><p>Thanks for supporting my fundraising.

He was the most loving, caring, generous and funny person we have ever known who would literally do anything for his family.

I understand the importance of keeping not just our hearts healthy but our arteries too, which means cutting down on the sugar!!</p><p>But let's face it, when covid came, everything went out of the window. Supermarket shelves in the chocolate aisle were completely bare, there was a longer queue in costa especially now with their delicious after eight hot chocolate and a box of milk tray would only last an hour. Doesn't matter that it's cheaper to get a meal and probably the same calories, it gives comfort...but it's short lived. </p><p>I am a self confessed chocoholic and I am ashamed to say I have failed in previous dechox's as I felt I needed chocolate to function...and it probably didn't help when wearing a dechox badge in university where students behind me started eating more chocolate than usual. It was torture. However, 2020 has made me realise more what is important in life and one of them is our health. </p><p>I want to do this not just to see if I can do it or to cut down on chocolates. It's because I know how it feels to lose someone because of a heart condition, I know how it feels to have someone in your family with the condition. There are so much treatments that can help people with various heart conditions but we can't stop there. I'd like to see more treatments to help people have better quality of life, more support groups locally for newly diagnosed people and more awareness to help people recognise the early signs of a heart or circulatory disease. </p><p>I would be very grateful for donations of support.

So who better to do it for than in memory of our amazing daughter Chloe. January was an emotional month after major surgery and getting through Christmas.it was the first time she left the hospital On New Year’s Day, started chemo and finally we made it back home to sleep. She always seemed to face everything with a smile. So if she could face all that and still be her smiling adorable self, I can run 31 miles in 31 days ( hopefully without wetting myself... should have done those exercises more!) I will be doing each mile thinking of her, so please if you can donate anything to this amazing hospital and in memory of Chloe x x x This January, I'm kickstarting 2021 by taking part in Running off Christmas. I'll be running 31 miles throughout the month to raise money for Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity (GOSH Charity).

They have a lack of basic healthcare, severe food shortages and limited clean water.  

CARE is focused on helping the most vulnerable people, through distributing food to families in need, and cash vouchers so that families can purchase for themselves the food they need.

Over a year of fighting and fuel shortages has destroyed water pipes and water pumping facilities, so CARE is rehabilitating water sources and providing water tanks so women and children can get safe drinking water without having to travel long distances.

CARE is also providing hygiene kits, paying special attention to womens and children's needs.
