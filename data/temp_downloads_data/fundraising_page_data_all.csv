Macmillan have been able to provide support to our family and many others thanks to donations received and with your help they can continue to support people and their families in many ways. Macmillan produce extensive content and provide information for various different types of cancer, treatment, diet, finances, benefit eligibility, and so much more. The information within these leaflets and books in addition to the support found within their centres or on the telephones are absolutely invaluable to the individual with cancer but also to their friends &amp; family. <br/><br/>I personally felt less isolated once engaging with Macmillan and I felt more able to beneficially contribute to the wellbeing of not only my Dad but my Mum also.

Our four-legged fundraisers support the 400+ fundraising groups across the UK from Glasgow to Plymouth and everywhere in between.

Due to the current situation, most of our fundraising groups will not be out collecting this festive season, and our four-legged fundraisers will be very much missed! We hope you will do your bit and help us as we aim to raise enough for 12 new guide dog partnerships! Heres how you can join in:

I was one of these special children that was treated at Gosh and I couldn’t be prouder of this. I was diagnosed in 2013 with a rare heart condition that nearly killed me. Great ormond street helped my local hospital and worked along side them to get me better and to a place that I could function properly without being at risk. Visiting Gosh and being treated there for around 3 years was amazing. I got to see hands on the work the amazing staff do and how they care for children who need them, so I wanted to give a little back to them. Not only have they helped me physically I was also supported mentally as this I something I really did and still struggle with.

The lifeguards keeping watch on 240 of the busiest beaches in the UK and Channel Islands.
