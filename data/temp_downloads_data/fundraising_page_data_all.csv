EGGsausted many many many puns thinking of what to call this page ! More so very welcomed 

So basically I am shaving my hair off in the hope that you lovely lot will help me raise some propper good mega dosh for three amazing charities 

Yes three, I couldn't settle on one and had to narrow it down because they' re all so wonderful ! I narrowed it down finally

MIND -  1in4 of us experiance mental health issues every year and with the impact of 2020 mental health support is crucial, MIND offers the support and information. and undoubtedly saves lives 

 MACMILLIAN - Amazing charity offering support to those suffering with cancer 

and  

 LOROS which is an incredable Leicester based hospice that runs entirely from donations

Well, four charities  if you include my hair donation to The Little Princess Trust which is absolutly amazing and makes wigs for little ones who need them.

I'd absolutly love to hit 3k as then thats a lovely 1k to each charity but I'd also like to absolutly smash that figure out of the park too , 

I know its has been a terrible year for all of us in our little lifeboats bobing along tring cloing on with white knuckles and ride the psunami of the rona and 2020 goings on so please give what you can because what these services consistantly provide is absolutly paramont. Please have a dig in your pockets and donate what you can ,I dont want to be baldilocks and the three hairs for a tenner you know!</p>","Charlotte for MACMILLIAN","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"they're amazing",NA,NA,NA,NA,"e732e3c6-ebbc-449f-b197-81ea7836eab8","CharlotteAtkinson",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Thankfully I had a FANTASTIC team who have now made me a CANCER SURVIVOR!! Part of that team was the most amazing MacMillan nurse – Jane. Jane was always at the end of the phone or an email to answer all of my questions and to check in on me. When you get diagnosed with cancer, you are assigned a MacMillan nurse and they are the greatest resource ever! 

So many people have been impacted by this horrible disease and supported by MacMillan Cancer Support. We are raising as much money as we can to ensure others will have the same support that I had.

I am no cyclist, I am about to cycle 178 miles/286 KMs over 3 days! London - Bruges, over BIG hills, along windy coastal roads and navigating the traffic out of London. This is a major challenge for me. It is also a real privilege to do this with family and friends. We are 21 in total - this is a mixed ability group and for most of us this will be our 1st cycling road challenge and is a HUGE challenge :-)

So please dig deep and give as much as you can for this worthy cause. We will do you proud and suffer the saddle sores!</p>","Musidora’s page","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"https://images.justgiving.com/image/0fdd6eb7-2d27-432a-8170-fcb1f5dce08f.jpg","https://images.justgiving.com/image/0fdd6eb7-2d27-432a-8170-fcb1f5dce08f.jpg?template=size150x150face",NA,NA,"7a65a340-9d2b-4efa-b893-888e8928f54e","TeamPenni",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I can pay a high, middle or low fee and am expected to raise a certain amount according to the fee. Any shortfall I will have to make up personally.

It's all above board, in black n white. Leave within Facebook comments or donation comments. The winner will be the one who is closest to my finish time. You will win a £50 Amazon voucher.

There are many different strains of meningitis something I was totally unaware<br/>of before Teddy got poorly. The symptoms in neonatal babies is massively under publicised which is why I was so shocked when I was told he was being treated for meningitis before we had a diagnosis.

Not only that, they gave me counselling to help me get through the pain of losing her, especially as I was so young at the time.

Each day at the hospice is special. By getting to know people as individuals, we help them do what is important to them  whether thats getting out into the hospice garden to enjoy the views across the sea, having a beloved pet visit come to visit or sharing precious moments with their loved ones.

We need to raise £8,311 per day to run the hospice, so every penny counts. Thank you for helping to make sure more people with a terminal illness in Cardiff and the Vale get the care and support they need.

More than ever we need the RNLI’s help. As a charity, the RNLI depends on our donations so it can go on saving lives and keeping us and our loved ones safe. 

RNLI lifesavers are our lifeline. They’re the lifeboat crews who provide 24-hour search and rescue right around the UK and Ireland. The lifeguards keeping watch on 240 of the busiest beaches in the UK and Channel Islands. And the RNLI safety teams and educators working tirelessly to stop people getting into trouble in the first place.
