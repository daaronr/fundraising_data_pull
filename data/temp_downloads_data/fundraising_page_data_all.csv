When you make a donation to the wonderful Macmillan Cancer Support charity via this page, the thank you email will contain a link to a digital copy of the Harland and Wolff crane doodle. You'll need to make sure you provide an email address when you make your donation. You'll get three files altogether:</p><ul><li>Original art with textured paper background</li><li>Original art with white background</li><li>Original art with white background (without text).</li></ul><p>The image file is 1000x1000px, or 10&#34;x10&#34; at 300DPI.</p><p>The donation receipt will contain a link to a Google Drive folder with the images for you. You may need to wait a few minutes for the email, and you may need to copy and paste the address into your favourite browser!</p><p><b>Why would I want a digital image?</b></p><p>With your digital image, you can take it to your favourite printers and do whatever you like with it! Websites like VistaPrint will allow you to create prints, canvas, mousemats, mugs, magnets, stickers, greeting cards - you name it.<br/>The original image is 10x10&#34; - you may be able to take it larger than this without losing any quality, but I cannot guarantee it.<br/>For any item that isn't square, you may need to do some further image editing at your end. </p><p>Please consider the digital file a &#34;thank you&#34; from me, to do with as you like. I cannot offer technical support, and obviously cannot offer refunds! :) The digital file is yours to keep, whether you print it, use it as a phone wallpaper, or create a dart board! And if you've no idea what to do with a digital file, that's also OK! Your donation is massively appreciated.</p><p><b>Why Macmillan Cancer Support?</b></p><p>As some of you may know, in 2016 we lost my mum, Jennifer Nesbitt to cancer. Her loss was felt by many - a mum, a wife, a sister, a friend and so much more to many people. Everything happened quite quickly, and naturally the hardest part of losing someone is those last few days when you value your privacy and final days together. This is where Macmillan Care at Antrim Area Hospital really helped our family, giving us a dedicated and private room to share my mums final days with her. Places like this rely on charity donations - whether it's to buy a chair to seat an extra family member, or pay a nurse who's there to lend a shoulder to cry on. They offer a safe and special place to families in the most difficult times in their life, and every penny of this fundraise will help to continue the amazing support they provide.</p><p><b>A Word from Macmillan &amp; JustGiving</b></p><p>Thanks for supporting my fundraising.  At Macmillan, we give people with cancer everything we’ve got. If you’re diagnosed, your worries are our worries. We’re doing whatever it takes. But without your help we can’t support everyone who needs us.</p><p><span>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and secure.

Thanks to inspiration and circumstances, I feel that it's important at this time to fundraise for charity, and what better way than to run 50 miles in a month?! (there's a few better ways but oh well)</p><p>Cancer is something that my family and I have unfortunately faced head on very recently, especially regarding my auntie Jackie. Jackie Hughes unfortunately died on the 29th December 2020, after a long battle with breast cancer. She had become a heroic figure in her local community, due to her unwavering positivity and toughness, raising over £2,000 in a personal pledge in her memory. She especially loved running, taking part in many races around the North East, inspiring her friends and family to run with her in the process - and now it's my turn. This challenge is usually known as the Run50 Challenge for Maggie's Centres, but because this is being done in her memory, I am instead deciding to donate proceeds to Macmillan Cancer Support. This charity was fundamental in their care towards Jackie, which myself and the family are eternally grateful for.</p><p>As if not motivation enough, I have also recently learnt the news that my dad has been diagnosed with mouth cancer. Whilst very tough news to hear, the consultant has ensured us that this is both very treatable and curable - I can only hope for a swift recovery, especially in such an enormous year for my dad.</p><p>My target is £250, but I will be grateful for every single penny donated, especially in these financially straining times we are all under. Also, a special thanks goes out to Verity Stroud for inspiring me to give this a try, as she completed her Run50 Challenge with 12 days to spare (!!!!!)</p>","Joel's February Fifty","2.50","0","40","16","0",NA,NA,NA,"I am running 50 miles in February","I am running 50 miles in February",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
