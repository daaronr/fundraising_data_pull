No doom and gloom allowed!</p><p>I have taken inspiration from the twins at Coppafeel Charity and have decided to undertake a 5 hour bounce off.  The event coincides with the final of TGBBO, so my children and I will be channelling Bake Off vibes as we bounce (expect tunes ,glitter and Paul Hollywood masks). We will be bouncing on trampolines for 5 hours and streaming it live on Instagram - pray for my pelvic floor. Everyone who donates will also be entered in a raffle to win some fabulous prizes. </p><p>We are encouraging friends, family and facebook stalkers to join in the madness on the 28/11/2020. You can bounce, skip or jump for as long as your bladder dictates! </p><p>**HEALTH WARNING** if you already pee when laughing or sneezing then this probably isn't for you. No worries you can just donate instead. The charity sector has suffered greatly due to Covid-19, so any donations would be thoroughly appreciated, no matter how small.</p><p>Finally if anyone could lend us a mini trampoline that would be fab, or space hoppers it is!!</p><p>Macmillan Cancer Support is here to help everyone with cancer live life as fully as they can, providing physical, financial and emotional support. So whatever cancer throws your way, they're right right there with you. Lets help Macmillan continue to provide vital support through 2020. </p><p>Thanks for your support,</p><p>Cheryl (aka Star Bouncer)</p><p>xx</p>","The Great British Bounce Off","178.50","0","1939","194","0","https://images.justgiving.com/image/4e839b09-3807-48d7-ae85-3f87f09515bb.jpg","https://images.justgiving.com/image/4e839b09-3807-48d7-ae85-3f87f09515bb.jpg?template=size150x150face",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"We are bouncing to raise vital funds for Macmillan","We are bouncing to raise vital funds for Macmillan",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This work has never been more vital than during the coronavirus pandemic. Now more than ever it crucial to support global charities in order to bring the world together and move forward through this crisis.
