Whist she appeared fine her heart did not act as it should.. When a child walks into a room singing and dancing their hearts are racing, summers condition meant her heart was super slow even when racing around having fun and extremely low during periods of rest. The concern of her condition was it would cause fainting and her her to black out since her heart was not working as most people's should. </p><p><span>I was advised to let her continue through her early years as normal but to keep an eye out of any signs of dizziness, fainting and blackouts, this left me anxious to leave her, she eventually began nursery however I was concerned to go afar from my hometown incase she needed me... This is how loades of cakes blossomed, a way of working, showing her I could support her and still be there if she needed me. </span><br/></p><p><span>Eventually at the age of 7 she began showing signs she needed some help with her condition and so she had her 1st pacemaker fitted, she's now 11 and is on her 2nd pacemaker.. Its fair to say she's amazing!! Her pacemaker kicks in when her heart beats below 40bpm. And has aleviated all of the concerning side effects she began showing. </span></p><p><span>What was also amazing for me was the Care we got from Great Ormond Street, from the doctor who hugged me in the corridor after hearing her diagnosis, I was a young single mum, petrified and the hug is one I will never forget, to the one who blew her giant bubbles on the bed whilst I listened to how this would affect her future life. To the amazingly skilled Surgeons who filled us with reassurance when she was going into her first operation, the nurses who monitored her every hour after her operation, the volunteers who have helped us find wards, the volunteers working at the shop, absolutely every one... Though summers condition meant she can lead a fairly normal life, so many other children their can't. </span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>I wanted to make something to raise some money for the hospital, its a difficult time for us all so just a share is appreciated but if you can make a donation every donation will be entered into a raffle to win this Gingerbread House.

Despite that, and 8 operations to date - it remains a place full of people who feel like friends - the most amazing of staff. <br /><br />Whilst no amount of money would ever be enough to say thank you for all they have done for us, as a family and will continue to do...its a start. <br /><br />We want to give something back. <br /><br />Not forgetting the pioneering research they do to help the lives of children. <br /><br />It's quick, easy and secure to donate, just press the Give Now button!<br /><br />Wish me luck !

Although they couldn't save our sister the work they done for her and many other children is unbelievable. Therefore, every year we donate this amazing charity, however with 2020 being such a challenging year we have decided to do something special. This January, we are kickstarting 2021 by taking part in Running off Christmas. we will be running 31 miles each throughout the month to raise money for Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity (GOSH Charity). <br />After all the festivities and with the cold and wet weather January can bring, your donations to support Great Ormond Street Hospital's life saving work will keep us going when we need it most.

I have a close friend that was treated at Gosh, who will always be in our hearts. The hospital saved my best friend Tia’s life. <br /><br />When she was 2 she was diagnosed with Dilated Cardiomyopathy, this is heart failure. The condition is very serious. She became really ill very quickly. Tia had 12 operations on her heart before she was sent to Great Ormond Street. She was taken straight to intensive care. Tia was very very poorly. Her family were told that the only way to save Tia and keep her alive, was to have a heart transplant. Tias parents said it was such a scary time, they just wanted their little girl to be ok, they couldn’t bare the thought of loosing her. <br />They made the decision to put her on the urgent transplant list straight away. <br /><br />Tia was put into a coma as she was to weak to breath for herself. The family were just praying for a miracle. Tia was to poorly to wait for a donor on her own so she was fitted with a Berlin heart. This is a machine that attached to Tias heart, it worked Tias heart  for her as her heart wasn't working anymore. The operation for this was a big one, it took 14 hours. Tia stayed in intensive care in a drug induced coma for 4 months. <br />In total she had been in intensive care for 7 months and in a coma for 4. Tia was taken out of the coma just before Christmas. She had to be taught how to walk again as she had lost all her muscle, she had also lost so much weight so she was very weak.<br /><br />Thankfully in April 2010 after being on the list 5 months Tia had the call to say they had found a donor heart for her. Her Mum and Dad gave her a massive hug and handed her over to the amazing Doctors, Nurses and Surgeons hoping and praying that Tia would pull through this operation. The team worked all through the night for Tia and after 12 long hours she came back to intensive care without her Berlin heart, it had been replaced with a shiny new heart. Her amazing donor family made this happen along with all the hospital staff. I know Tia's family and friends are so grateful. Tia has to take medicine everyday to stop her heart rejecting. I always remind her if we are out, or having a sleepover. I try my best to look after Tia. She still goes to Gosh every couple of months. Sadly this year right in the middle of the Covid pandemic she became unwell, she sadly had rejection. I was scared for her, and so were her family. She had to stay in hospital and have high doses of medicines. Thankfully this worked for her. She is being very closely monitored, but the main thing is she is here with us all. <br /><br />Without Great Ormond Street my best friend wouldn’t be here. I want to give back whatever I can to show them I am so grateful for what they do. I am a gymnast and during the lockdowns I have been running a lot as my gym has been closed. I enjoy the running as it keeps me fit. I thought this challenge would be a good way to raise money for this amazing charity. Tia's Mum always says she wouldn’t wish their situation on anyone. She does also say that everyone should find comfort in knowing that if your child did become seriously unwell, Great Ormond Street are there for you and they will help you as much as they can. They saved Tias life on many occasions and for that we are truly grateful. I am hoping to raise as much money as possible for Gosh. If you could donate to my page I would be so grateful. No donation is to small, every little helps. Thank you for reading my page, stay safe and have a very merry Christmas. <br />Love Nicole xx","Nicole is running for her best friend Tia and all the families at Gosh","0","0","0","0","0",NA,"true",NA,"https://images.justgiving.com/image/73bbadf4-cf16-4753-973f-e144d7ed4e87.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true",NA,"https://images.justgiving.com/image/73bbadf4-cf16-4753-973f-e144d7ed4e87.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true",NA,NA,"73d345e9-c72b-4dff-b0f6-ebe17ca58037",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As a keen sailor I have huge respect for the sea and even more respect for the brave men and women of the Howth RNLI who have assisted so many of my friends over the years. Despite living as close to the sea as it is possible without being in it, I have only recently started sea swimming, a Lockdown activity I took up in March of this year. Our daily (Socially Distanced) swims have kept us healthy in mind and body throughout this difficult year and have made me even more aware of the importance of the Lifeboat to us all. Due to the restrictions imposed on us all by the virus many fund raising events have been curtailed. To this end, would you be willing to support me in my Christmas Day swim and make a small contribution to Howth RNLI. My (no wet suit) swim will last approx. 15 minutes. Any longer and I may require rescuing by the very people I am trying to help.</span></p><p><!--EndFragment--><font color=""#222222"">Scorie<br/></font><br/><br/></p>","RNLI Ireland - Lifesavers Fund","0","0","190","38","0",NA,"true",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"d05f461e-6c31-4f97-bfcf-42e03d1cc990",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
