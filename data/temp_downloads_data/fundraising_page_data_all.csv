My sister was diagnosed with breast cancer back in September at the age of 25, and has been going through chemotherapy during the pandemic with my family effectively isolating since September. During her treatment she has been supported by Macmillan, who have provided crucial information for her, as well as providing a network to support her if the need ever arose . My sister has shown incredible resilience, and I cannot begin to describe my pride for her, for this reason I want to support those who can actively support my sister, as well as other cancer sufferers.<br/>I realise over the pandemic that many organised events, such as marathons and other fundraising events have not been able to go ahead, which makes supporting groups such as Macmillan more crucial than ever. </p><p><br/>My fundraiser challenge is to run 250km in January, which is:<br/>•    5.9 full marathons<br/>•    42.4 laps of Silverstone circuit<br/>•    Further than London to Cardiff (242.6 Km)<br/></p><p><span>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and secure.

In January this year my Grandma had a double heart bypass and is recovering really well. And my Grandad has diabetes and I know that this can cause other conditions that can raise the risk for heart disease. <br/><br/>As you can see the British Heart Foundation is close to my heart *excuse the pun*.

Give before 4 February 2021 and your donation will be doubled by the UK government, up to £2 million, making double the difference in communities across Ethiopia. Together, we will bring clean water to 50,000 people in Ethiopia and thousands more around the world, helping them change their own lives, forever. Can you imagine not having fresh clean drinking water at the turn of a tap? It's something we all take for granted and don't even have to think about.
