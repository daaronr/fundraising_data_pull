She had fought bravely for 18 months and tried everything to stay with us, her family and friends. </p><p>The help and support that she received from Macmillan throughout her illness was amazing, and I know that they are still there for us if we need them. We know that Caroline would like us to support this wonderful charity and be able to give something back so that they can carry on supporting others in their times of need.</p><p>Caroline was only 41 when she was taken from us and leaves behind 5 beautiful children. We are all bewildered and devastated by her loss and are trying to come to terms with how unfair life can be. We know that she wouldn't want us to be sad at her passing but celebrate her life which she always tried to live to the full. She has been described as strong willed, determined and funny, a lovely woman and so full of life, a beautiful and honest lady and so many people have lovely memories of her.</p><p>Unfortunately, we cannot invite many people to the funeral, so we are asking for a small donation to Macmillan as a way of remembering Caroline until we can all come together for a proper celebration of her life. We know her life touched so many people so really hope we can help her to give something back to such a wonderful cause.</p><p>Thank you for all the lovely kind words of support we have received, we really do appreciate every one of them. </p>","Remembering Caroline","101.25","0","490","49","0",NA,"To remember the life of our friend and sister Caz because they provided help and support when she needed it","To remember the life of our friend and sister Caz","they provided help and support when she needed it",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and social workers are supported by a team of volunteers, who play a vital role in the running of the hospice.

Some of the people we support stay in our in-patient unit, where relatives and friends can visit any time of the day or night and stay with their loved ones if they wish to.

We also support local people with clinics, therapies and activities during the day  including one-to-one care, groups and things like reiki and massage. 

As well as people with a terminal illness, we also support carers and families with things like bereavement support groups where people can share their experiences and feelings.

Thank you for supporting us, and helping to make sure more people with a terminal illness in Edinburgh get the care and support they need.

Marie Curie were a huge support not just to her but also to all the family during this very difficult time. The care and kindness that was offered during the last few days was outstanding. <br/><br/>I am wanting to raise as much money as possible for Marie Curie in memory of Claude. If you havent heard of them, they provide care and support for people living with any terminal illness, and their families. There is a clear link between Coronavirus lockdown and treatments/operations/diagnosis being delayed, so now is a good time to be raising money for them. 2020 has not been an easy year for charities with fund raising events having been cancelled.<br/><br/>Starting on Tuesday 1st December, I will be running 5k through the Yorkshire countryside every single day of the month, with my loyal Labrador Bramble. I will upload my routes daily to show my progress and hopefully improve my time!<br/><br/>Please donate if you can to this wonderful charity. <br/><br/>Very many thanks, <br/><br/>Ali &amp; Bramble<br/></p>","Ali's 5k Every Day in December 2020","0","0","0","0","0",NA,"In memory of Claudia Ann Hanson because a much loved daughter, mum, grandmother and auntie","In memory of Claudia Ann Hanson","a much loved daughter, mum, grandmother and auntie",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
