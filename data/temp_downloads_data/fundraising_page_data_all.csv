We both wanted to run this challenge to help raise money for a cause very close to our hearts. We’ve both lost too many family members to the big C and want to do our bit to try and improve the research and the care that is given. Ims’ mum is currently undergoing treatment for bowel and ovarian cancer and the work that Macmillan do is integral to help support her throughout the process. Any help you can offer, whether it’s support on our runs, to read a bit more about cancer and identify early signs, or to even donate to our page it would be hugely appreciated.

A type called Lymphoma. She attended one of the most incredible places ever. My Nan was so poorly, and needed to undergo a stem cell transplant in order to save her life. Each treatment costs between £50,000-£12,000. She stayed in the cotton rooms, a hotel which accommodates for patients of the UCHL. By no means does it look like a hospital, but just a normal hotel room. They took care of my Nan and granddad so well, and met all her needs. The nurses, doctors, specialists and all other staff at the Macmillan centre and cotton rooms, worked so so so hard; day in and day out. My Nan is my best friend and my inspiration, and it’s my turn to make a difference. I want to make my Nan proud, and help save lives of many other poorly people with amazingly sad stories, who deserve longer in this world. I never ever heard my Nan moan once, never sulked, never took a day for granted. We are so lucky. This is my chance to help out. I’m not a marathon runner, what so ever, but I’m going to give 100%. Please donate, even if it’s £1 it DOES make a difference. Thank you. </p>","Millie's half marathon.","0","0","0","0","0","PersonalRunning_Marathons","I’m running a half marathon because I want to help the charity, to save lives.","I’m running a half marathon",NA,"https://images.justgiving.com/image/2e0137a5-cb08-4100-8371-c5e15449574c.jpg","https://images.justgiving.com/image/2e0137a5-cb08-4100-8371-c5e15449574c.jpg?template=size150x150face","I want to help the charity, to save lives.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our four-legged fundraisers support the 400+ fundraising groups across the UK from Glasgow to Plymouth and everywhere in between.

Due to the current situation, most of our fundraising groups will not be out collecting this festive season, and our four-legged fundraisers will be very much missed! We hope you will do your bit and help us as we aim to raise enough for 12 new guide dog partnerships! Heres how you can join in:

The sponsorship money you raise will make a difference. £100 could pay for five hours' training at a Guide Dogs training school.

It's thanks to people like you that we can continue to provide life-changing services, like our guide dogs, to people with sight loss. So, a huge thank you and lots of luck for your challenge!

During December hundreds of our fundraising dogs across the UK would usually be out and about wagging their tails and meeting you at supermarket and street collections, Christmas fairs and festive coffee mornings. Our four-legged fundraisers support the 400+ fundraising groups across the UK from Glasgow to Plymouth and everywhere in between.

Due to the current situation, most of our fundraising groups will not be out collecting this festive season, and our four-legged fundraisers will be very much missed! We hope you will do your bit and help us as we aim to raise enough for 12 new guide dog partnerships! Heres how you can join in: 

	Donate £12 and share our posts across social media nominating a friend, family member or colleague to  get involved

Despite our age difference, she was a consistent and loving presence in my life. Most of my fondest childhood memories, and many of my adult ones, feature Kathy. Her kindness to me, especially at times when everything else felt a bit uncertain, her willingness to laugh, and her love for her family are examples to us all. This love grew to encompass Coree (who she, from a sense of compassion, and perhaps sisterly-nosiness, invited to join us for a Christmas Eve celebration very early on in our relationship. Luckily Coree received the seal of approval) and later Teddy. Our last visit included a trip to the outdoor centre near Kathy’s home. Teddy was enamoured with the ride-on construction vehicles and Kathy joined him in his fun. When Coree and I tried to chivvy him along to see the other exhibits, she turned to us and said ‘He’s having so much fun, let him play!’ She was determined, despite treatments which often left her poorly, to squeeze every last bit of pleasure out of life and encouraged us to do the same.</p><p><br/></p><p>Mourning her passing, and celebrating her life, was made more difficult due to the pandemic and I’ve struggled since to figure out how best to commemorate her life.
