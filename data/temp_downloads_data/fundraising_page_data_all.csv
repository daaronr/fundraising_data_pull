My dad has his first heart attack on his 61st Birthday back in the late 1980's. He recovered and went back to work at R.G.T.approx 6 months later. He had worked at RGT since leaving school. He took a deserved early retirement at 64, but only saw 4 years of retirement. He went out one Thursday morning in November 1994 to collect his and my Mum's pension only to never return. He died of a heart attack whilst collecting their pension. I was at work that morning in Lincoln and will never forget the phone call from home giving me the news.</p><p><span>He loved his football and cricket and took me to my first ever game at Sincil Bank to watch The Imps. I was stood on the West Bank terracing against the wall and it was chuffing freezing !! But </span>I<span> kept </span>going<span> back for more.</span></p><p><span>So after much deliberation I have decided to have a go at this challenge as I am now 61, the same age as my Dad when he had his first attack and feel should make an effort and contribute again to this worthy charity.The challenge also starts 2 days before his birthday.</span></p><p><span>Please give generously folk.</span></p><p><span>Many Thanks.</span></p><p>Go The Distance .100 Km .

I am raising money for Marie Curie. Marie Curie is the UK’s leading end of life charity. Providing frontline nursing and hospice care, a free support line and a wealth of information and support on all aspects of dying, death and bereavement. I have chosen to take this on to prove to myself that I can do it and cross that finish line and in the process do something good! </p><p> My goal is to raise £1000 for Hope for Children between now and August! I hope you can spare a couple of pounds for this charity!</p><p>I appreciate you taking the time to read and donate! :D </p></div><!--EndFragment--><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p>","Tobias's Budapest Marathon 2021 page","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"true","true","0b7a663e-630e-448f-a9b6-ed3f166be9a0","ExeUniRunsForMarieCurie",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
