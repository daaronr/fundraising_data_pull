We managed to spend a lovely couple of weeks with him at the end of September in Devon which he really enjoyed. Sadly he passed away in his sleep a week later in his own home which he loved. The funeral is 26/10/2020 at 2.40pm. It will be family flowers only thank you but anyone wishing to donate to the British heart foundation we will be so grateful.
