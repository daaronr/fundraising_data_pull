My name is Bobby Gotelee. Thank you for taking the time to read this. For those who don't know me, I support Great Ormond Street through my workplace, and have been doing so for over 5 years. I am mainly known for my ""24 hour in a bed"" stints and my walk offs, in which I have done a fair few challenges in regards to that. This January, I'm kickstarting 2021 by taking part in Running off Christmas. Now, while most people will be running off the 31 miles, I'll be walking it throughout the month to raise money for Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity (GOSH Charity). After all the festivities and with the cold and wet weather January can bring, your donations to support Great Ormond Street Hospital's life saving work will keep me going when I need it most.
