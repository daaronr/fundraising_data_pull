We continued as a family to live our lives for several years thinking she was cancer free when cancer struck for a second time. This time leaving it’s mark by making my mum terminally ill. Unfortunately, after all that treatment the doctors missed that the cancer had spread to other parts of the body, meaning it is incurable. We are in our final option of the delay process which is chemotherapy (and it is a nasty piece of shit). Myself and my family continue to fight this day in and out. I am not only doing this for my mum but for everyone affected by Cancer.</p><p>To continue the fight I have decided to come up with 4 weekly challenges in no particular order to raise money and awareness: </p><p>Week 1 - Head Shave </p><p>Week 2 - Cycle from Nottingham to Mansfield </p><p>Week 3 - Half Marathon </p><p>Week 4 - 24 hours without food</p><p>I don’t know how my body will adapt to these challenges. I can’t remember the last time I had my head shaved let alone go without food for a day. This will be a physical and emotional battle, therefore, I will need the support of my friends and family.</p><p>2020 hasn’t been easy, but all I know is that Cancer doesn’t stop through a pandemic.</p><p>Thanks to the unconditional support of my friends and family I have been able to beat every fundraising target in the past. This time I hope to do the same.</p><p>If anyone would like to join me or take part please get in touch!</p><p>Finally, I also urge for you check yourself. The earlier you find it, the better your chances. If you’re unsure seek medical advice.</p><p>Floyd :)</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.
