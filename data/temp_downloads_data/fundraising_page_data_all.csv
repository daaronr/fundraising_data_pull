The Coronavirus Pandemic this year has significantly impacted the monies being donated to these worthwhile charities - money that is desperately needed to continue research and support functions of those charities.

Therefore the PENTEN and OITC teams have proposed a ""Virtual"" event where people may take part on the same day but in their own time whilst maintaining social distancing rules

OCD shift workers may also choose a different day to take part

Therefore for 2020 we will be raising money for the British Heart Foundation There is a choice of three events - indoor or outdoor

Cycling

Challenge 1 - Minimum 20 miles

Challenge 2 - Minimum 50 miles

Running

Challenge 1 - Minimum 5K

Challenge 2 - Minimum 10K

Walking

Challenge 1 - Minimum 5K

Challenge 2 - Minimum 10K

The event will take part on the 28th November 2020

So please join the Team and raise money as much money as possible for an extremely worthwhile cause

There is a small joining fee of £10 which of course will go towards the total raised.

So please register and Join in have fun and support a worthy cause!!!

I'm raising money for the British Heart Foundation and I'd be so grateful for your support. Back on 30th March this year, to my shock I suffered a heart attack at the tender age of 45, thanks to the amazing work of Derriford hospital in Plymouth, I am here to tell the story. From that day on I vowed to change the way I lived and with the support of BHF In the first few weeks, got me through. The work that BHF do saved mine and so many lives , it is my time to give back. I will be doing a 5k a day for 7 consecutive days on the lead up to Christmas starting on  the 18th December. The BHF has helped halve the number of people dying from heart and circulatory disease in the UK but sadly every day hundreds of people lose their lives. It's only thanks to support from people like us that the BHF can create new treatments and discover new cures. £24 could pay for two hours of research by an early career scientist, but every pound helps so please give what you can to help me hit my target.

RNLI lifeboats in the South West protect hundreds of communities through their 24-hour search and rescue service. They rely on the safest, most reliable lifeboats and modern stations to launch from. The stunning coastline of Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Somerset, Isles of Scilly and the Channel Islands are enjoyed by millions of people from across the country every year. But the water remains an unpredictable environment that can catch people out. People will always need our help and we will always be there to answer that call.The RNLI relies on donations from you the public to continue saving lives at sea.</p>","Remembering Phillip Tamblin","6.25","0","25","10","0","Phillip Tamblin","true","true","821561","Phillip Tamblin","/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/13555686","remember/821561",NA,NA,"f23f97e1-ff2e-4cb0-ab56-093b1e85f355","https://images.justgiving.com/image/1f37b655-6f13-4530-b0a7-2c160fabd11f.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true","https://images.justgiving.com/image/1f37b655-6f13-4530-b0a7-2c160fabd11f.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
