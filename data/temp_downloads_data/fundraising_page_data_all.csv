This winter may be our toughest yet and I am helping to bring some community spirit by sharing my sparkle by supporting St John. 

St John volunteers treat and transport thousands of patients each year, and in times of crisis we are England's national health reserve.  

During the pandemic our skilled and highly trained volunteers are working long shifts supporting sick people and their families, in hospitals, in ambulances and at home. We are proud to be working alongside the nations ambulance trusts and in hospitals around the country.

""I enjoy helping people and its what I have been training to do. Its very rewarding personally knowing that my colleagues and I are making a difference to peoples lives when they most need it.""

Guide Dogs remains committed to supporting people with sight loss across the UK.

It has never been more important to come together online and support one another. We appreciate times are difficult right now, but for people with sight loss, social isolation can be their every day. 

By hosting a virtual collection for Guide Dogs, every pound you or your group raises will ensure we can continue to help people with sight loss and feel less alone, now and in the future.

These include yoga, exercise classes and relaxation. People using the day unit can also get together over a freshly cooked lunch from our chefs.Relatives and friends can visit any time of the day or night, and stay with their loved ones if they wish to.

Every single day at the hospice is an extraordinary day. 

We listen, support and give high-quality care during what can be a difficult, challenging and distressing time. And we get to know people as individuals, find out what makes them happy, and help to make those things happen.

That might mean sitting with them in the hospice garden, or arranging for their pet to visit them at the hospice. We focus on the special things that bring people joy.

We also provide important support for carers and families, including bereavement support and counselling.

We need to raise £6,150 per day to run the hospice, so every penny counts. Thank you for helping to make sure more people with a terminal illness in and around Belfast, get the care and support they need.

Our volunteer crews rely on the safest, most reliable lifeboats and modern stations to launch from. 
Scotlands unrivalled coasts and waters are valued by local communities and visitors alike, with millions travelling to enjoy them, and work on them each year. But the water remains an unpredictable environment that can catch people out. People will always need our help and we will always be there to answer that call.
Keeping a modern fleet of lifeboats maintained, fuelled and ever ready to go to the rescue from all 46 of the lifeboat stations in Scotland is expensive and we rely entirely on voluntary donations to ensure this service is maintained. It costs an average of £155k to run a lifeboat station in Scotland but with the implications of Covid-19, we havent been able to fundraise as normal to help keep our lifeboats afloat.

Just £30 could provide a full kit to protect a health-worker on the frontline, including gloves, masks and coveralls, while just £43 could help provide 1,680 pairs of disposable gloves for health workers.
The impact of a large-scale outbreak of coronavirus on children, especially poor and vulnerable children, has been immense. Children are at risk from the disease, but also from the disruption to health and education services, impacts on caregivers, and separation from family members.
Unicef has been working closely with governments and the World Health Organization (WHO) since the start of the coronavirus outbreak. Donations made to my page will help to limit the spread of the virus and reduce the impact on children and families.
