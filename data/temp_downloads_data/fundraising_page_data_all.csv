This could’ve been a tragic story if we hadn’t found out and it only came to light purely by luck after the family obtaining a bp machine which everybody wanted to ‘have a go on’ When he done his the results were alarming to say the least.

Yes that is 26 miles!!! </p><p><span>I'm raising money for the British Heart Foundation and I'd be so grateful for your support. I have chosen this charity as I have had several family members affected by heart conditions. The British Heart Foundation </span><span>has helped halve the number of people dying from heart and circulatory disease in the UK but sadly every day hundreds of people lose their lives. It's only thanks to support from people like us that the BHF can create new treatments and discover new cures. £24 could pay for two hours of research by an early career scientist, but every pound helps so please give what you can to help me hit my target.</span></p><p><span>Thank you for your support whether via a donation or a message of encouragement, all appreciated.

Unfortunately it was not all plain sailing for him, Finley was born with a cleft lip and palate, however the cleft went all the way up to his skull which meant he had an opening in the front of his skull causing his brain to poke through, as a result of this his eye was also displaced.</p><p>When Finley was 2 months old he underwent major life threatening surgery to repair the hole in his forehead which involved the best surgeons in the world (who work at Great Ormond Street)</p><p>They managed to repair the hole using another part of his skull to keep his brain in place, the surgery lasted around 11 hours so it was a horrible time for everybody who loved him.</p><p>Since <span style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);float: none;"">this surgery was completed he has also had surgery on his eyelid &amp; lip as well as constant check ups at Great Ormond Street for various different reasons and to be honest it has just become a way of life for him.</span></p><p><!--EndFragment-->Growing up Fin has always looked different to other kids but yet he is the happiest (when playing football) and most outgoing child you will meet, nothing seems to faze him whatsoever!</p><p>Early next year Finley has life changing surgery which will be performed by the worlds best surgeons at GOSH. They will be performing a procedure to move his eye up and get it symmetrical to the other side, this is absolutely huge for him!</p><p>Throughout all of this the GOSH team have been absolutely amazing with Fin and his family, every single staff member has been a credit to the hospital.</p><p><u><b>So why am I doing something?</b></u></p><p>Well I have been in Finleys life since the day he was born and love him like he is my brother. I have watched his whole journey unfold and been by his side all the way, I am super proud of the amazing child he is.

Cancer Research UK is the world's leading charity dedicated to research on the causes, treatment and prevention of cancer. Thanks to research, more people are surviving cancer than ever before. Thanks in advance for any contribution to this cause that means so much to us. We have both been personally effected, losing family members to cancer and have decided to do this run in support of a charity that did so much to help our loved ones and our families.</span></p><div style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51);text-align: left;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">William Ridley (30th October 1940- 7th October 2021)</div><div style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51);text-align: left;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">William Ridley- my inspiration, my joy, my support- was not just a Grandad to me; he was my best friend. He fought hard for 8 years with lung cancer, despite the original bleak diagnosis of just a few months.  He taught me more about love and sacrifice then anyone I have ever known.  My Grandad was my biggest supporter and all I have ever wanted is to make him proud. I know that he would have loved to be there with us on the 27th of November with a big smile (and a sausage sandwich.) I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone that has helped me and my family during this difficult time - we truly do appreciate it. Please donate anything you can to try to this brilliant charity and cause. Thank you for all your kind messages but most of all; thank you Grandad.

At the same time when I can be having the best days of my life, somebody else is already aware that the very same days are their last ones, aware that they are not able to spend them as safely, peacefully, and with dignity, as they would wish. That can be changed and we all can help, offer the piece of being taken care of to terminally ill patients in this difficult moment. And that is something which shouldn't really have a price, but in reality, does. A big one.

Sponsor me to help WWF protect our one shared home. Climate change poses the biggest threat to the future of our planet. The Earth's atmosphere is warming, faster than it probably ever has. This causes negative impacts such as the melting of Arctic sea-ice, prolonged heat-waves and rising sea-levels. It may seem a bit chilly for some of us, but the Arctic is crucial for lots of reasons. Its home to around four million people, including indigenous communities, and there's an amazing amount of wildlife too, all uniquely adapted to life in this icy landscape. Polar bears, penguins and walrus call this freezing landscape their home. But their environment is changing, because of global warming. The sea ice during the summer months is declining, and with global warming, that ice is shrinking fast. By sponsoring me to Brave the Chill, together we can help protect our one shared home.</p>","Marianna","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
