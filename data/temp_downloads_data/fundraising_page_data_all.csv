Dale’s wonderful dad Glyn passed away due to heart problems in 2018. It was devastatingly unexpected and sadly this is the reality for many families. The Dechox challenge is very simple and a great way to help raise money that the British Heart Foundation so desperately need. We are taking on the level 3 challenge of giving up chocolate, sweets and fizzy drinks. We have also decided we want to make it more of a challenge and we will be giving up alcohol too, and commit to being as healthy as we possibly can be. We will be eating healthy, exercising and adhering to a strict diet and have agreed that we will donate £1 for every pound we loose before the end of March on top of our current donations. <b>We want to raise as much as we can in memory of Glyn</b>. £150 is a small target but we are hoping to smash that and move the target up as we go. The BHF help so many families that go through awful times and provide care and support for those that need it, while also putting every effort into groundbreaking research to save millions of lives. </p><p><br/></p><p>We are grateful to anyone that is able to donate any amount, especially when we are all suffering from this pandemic.

One of our key goals is to hit £8500 which is the cost of running one hospice for just one day. 

On January 29th we will be doing our first team fundraiser by running a joint 150km.

Through David I met his son Adam and did a Wiggle event in France with them. Unfortunately Adam was diagnosed with a brain tumour and sadly passed away in December of 2019. Through his last few weeks he was cared for by the Marie Curie Hospice team in Newcastle and it seems the right charity to donate all of the money raised for this event as one close to Adam's family and for the support that they gave Adam until the end.</p><p>Some details of the hospice are below....</p><p>We're here to support people with serious illnesses in the Newcastle area to have the best quality of life possible, whatever that might mean for them. Our hospice team includes doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, social workers and many more, and is supported by over 100 volunteers, who play a vital role in the running of the hospice. Some people stay in our 20-bed in-patient unit, where relatives and friends can visit any time of the day or night, and stay with their loved ones if they wish. Our day therapy unit offers outpatient clinics and a wide range of activities and therapies, including baking, art therapy and relaxation. We also provide support for carers and families, including our social work team who provide emotional and practical advice. Our chaplain is here to provide spiritual care to patients and their loved ones.

I am taking on the ultimate detox by avoiding caffeine, alcohol and all other drinks while supporting WaterAid. Give before 4 February 2021 and your donation will be doubled by the UK government, up to £2 million, making double the difference in communities across Ethiopia. Together, we will bring clean water to 50,000 people in Ethiopia and thousands more around the world, helping them change their own lives, forever.
