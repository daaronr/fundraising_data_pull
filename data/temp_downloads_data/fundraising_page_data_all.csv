During December hundreds of our fundraising dogs across the UK would usually be out and about wagging their tails and meeting you at supermarket and street collections, Christmas fairs and festive coffee mornings. Our four-legged fundraisers support the 400+ fundraising groups across the UK from Glasgow to Plymouth and everywhere in between.

Due to the current situation, most of our fundraising groups will not be out collecting this festive season, and our four-legged fundraisers will be very much missed! We hope you will do your bit and help us as we aim to raise enough for 12 new guide dog partnerships! Heres how you can join in:

Just £30 could provide a full kit to protect a health-worker on the frontline, including gloves, masks and coveralls, while just £43 could help provide 1,680 pairs of disposable gloves for health workers.
The impact of a large-scale outbreak of coronavirus on children, especially poor and vulnerable children, has been immense. Children are at risk from the disease, but also from the disruption to health and education services, impacts on caregivers, and separation from family members.
Unicef has been working closely with governments and the World Health Organization (WHO) since the start of the coronavirus outbreak. Donations made to my page will help to limit the spread of the virus and reduce the impact on children and families.
