We lost our legend. </p><p>Edward, Eddie as most of you know him. A husband of 46 years to his most treasured soul mate Eileen, dad to two sons and the most tremendous Grandad, not forgetting an incredible Great-Grandad. </p><p>A golfing extraordinaire, a fabulous cook (nan over saw some of that) and a true gentleman. He was funny, gentle, kind and so loving. Each and every person that met him, would remember him forever. </p><p>Everyone that ever met my grandad would always remember him for being one of the nicest people you'd ever met. </p><p>As for being a grandad, I always used to describe him as your typical grandad, typical in that he was the one who cuddled you the tightest, the one who always spoilt you, fed you up until you burst, always asked how you were and took interest in your life and who cheeklily put money in your hand when he left you. He was the sweetest, kindest grandad who completely made my childhood full of the most special times and fondest memories. I challenge you to find a better husband, dad, grandad, great-grandad, son, brother and friend....you won't. One in a million weren't you! </p><p>He had so many friends who I know just loved being around him, he'd always talk about his friends and family to everyone. He truly was the proudest man of everyone he had in his life. </p><p><span>I think I speak for everyone when I say we are utterly devastated. </span><br/></p><p>My nan had the idea of setting up a donation page for Great Ormond Street, he probably spoke about it lots to some, but for those who don't know it was a charity close to home. </p><p>Myself and his two great-grandchildren have been cared for by this wonderful hospital for many years and the two little one's continue to be treated and cared for by them for life long illnesses. </p><p>Instead of flowers my nan would like you to make a small donation to this charity, we have been informed funeral flowers are sadly just thrown away so feel its a better cause for money to go to charity. </p><p>Once this current situation is over we will throw him the party/send off he deserves. He loved a Bbq and drink up didn't he and that is what we will give him. </p><p>Thank you all for your continued support, kind messages and for being there. </p><p>xxx</p><p>Love you Ed/Dad/Grandad </p><p><span>Thanks for taking the time to visit my JustGiving page.</span><br/></p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

This strain has been felt in all areas, including screening, diagnosis and treatment. Figures have revealed the sheer scale of this disruption – estimating that over 2 million people in the UK are waiting for screening, tests and treatment since the first lockdown began. Patients shouldn’t have to wait for Covid-19 to be over before getting the treatment they need.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">There has been a significant drop in the number of urgent referrals for cancer, with 290,000 less people being referred for further tests than normal. This drop is largely because fewer people are going to the GP with symptoms that might be cancer, GPs are reluctant to risk sending their patient to hospital for further tests, and some diagnostic services – such as endoscopies – have been put on hold due to the risk of spreading Covid-19.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Despite national guidelines stating that urgent and essential cancer treatments must continue, the impact of Covid-19 has been felt in cancer wards across the country, with surgery hit the worst. Around 12,750 people are waiting for cancer surgery across the UK, as the number of operations has fallen to around 60% of expected levels. Chemotherapy has also taken a hit, with over 6,000 fewer people than expected receiving chemotherapy since lockdown began.</p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The Coronavirus pandemic has put a lot of lab-based research on hold and forced most researchers to change the way they work. With most university and hospital sites closed, laboratories have slowed down their activities and experiments have stopped. Researchers are continuing to work from home, writing papers, analysing data but the progress of research will slow down, and this will inevitably have an impact on researcher’s careers and the lives of people affected by cancer.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>","Run 56 miles in February","0","0","40","20","0","true",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As you can imagine it was terrifying even if I did tried to pretend like I wasn't scared. I tried to stay calm but to see my whole family and support network distraught I could pretend any longer. I was petrified I was going to die. </p><p>The surgeons, the doctors, the nurses and every single person that was helping me were out of this world. Nothing was too much trouble, no diagram to explain everything was too much to ask and the friendliness and care I recieved was incredible. I was a very young patient for them all to be trea</p><p>ting for bowel cancer, which was new for them all, but they carried me through every step in a way I could comprehend (not enjoy but understand). The meetings and discussions that were carried out through many doctors nurses and professionals across the UK, to ensure I was given the best and fastest treatment was amazing. The course and plan of action was altered many times but only to ensure the best possible outcome for a young fertile, 20 year old girl. </p><p>The final plan was surgery as soon as possible, to prevent the tumour from spreading into more lymph nodes as it was growing at a rapid rate. By July I was in surgery, 2 weeks after I started fertility treatment and 11 eggs were harvested from me and put into storage, in September I started the gruelling course of chemotherapy. 8 sessions every 3 weeks, each session lasting 8 hours+. I still remember the sickening feeling as it started to run through my veins. I dreaded the 3 week mark returning but I knew I had to stick with it. Finally the last session came around in February and in March 2013 I was put into remission. </p><p><span>Without cancer research none of this would of been possible, the groundbreaking research is lifesaving and I am so thankful every day for the life I have been given. The battle was short in the grand scheme of being able to live a fulfilling life now. </span><br/></p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

Well, I wasn’t going to take up running at my tender old age, so my quest was simple; find a bike. </p><p>Eventually, through some miracle, I found one and I managed to get out and about. There I was, racking up the miles, getting fitter and falling into a pattern of regular exercise when I saw an advertisement to raise funds for a cancer charity – a story many of us can relate to. So, I got cracking, found some sponsorships, and completed the challenge with over £700 to donate. A great success!</p><p>Not being one to sit back and stop there, I turned my thoughts to something more personal.</p><p>Back in 2014, my life changed in a split second. January 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2014; the day my son Mike was taken from us off the coast of Cornwall. At 23 years old, Mike was a passionate fisherman, and that day he was out with his best mate looking for a fishing spot to settle down for the day. The last any of us heard from him, was his most recent Facebook status.</p><p><span class=""MsoIntenseEmphasis"">“Sex, drugs and rock and roll? Nah, fishing is the life for me!”</span></p><p>Then suddenly, a freak wave hit them both. His mate managed to hold on and call the emergency services, but Mike was swept out in seconds. The RNLI and air support were on the scene within 15 minutes. They never found him, and my life changed that day, forever.</p><p>But back to 2020; I had a lightbulb moment. I wanted to raise awareness again, and help the RNLI. </p><p>My challenge is to ride from the Weston super Mare RNLI station to Padstow RNLI station, visiting every other station on the way to thank the crews for what they do. The challenge will involve riding 200 miles over tough terrain with a total elevation of 16,000ft and will take four days to complete. I’m looking for a team of six to join me, with four of us already committed so far. </p><p>We are hoping to do the ride at the earliest possible date in spring inline with the latest Covid-19 restrictions - as soon as we have a confirmed date this will be posted - if you would like <span>to show your support by j</span><span>oining us on a section of the ride then please e-mail me at philipmfbindon@hotmail.co.uk </span></p><p>Come and join us, and ‘Ride your Bike for Mike’!</p><p></p>","RNLI Weston-Super-Mare to Padstow Cycle Challenge","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"https://images.justgiving.com/image/71017cad-c7dc-40fa-8c4f-146f53e316db.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true","https://images.justgiving.com/image/71017cad-c7dc-40fa-8c4f-146f53e316db.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true","https://images.justgiving.com/image/a65ad645-3a70-48a4-aafe-3c2f3d389864.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true","https://images.justgiving.com/image/a65ad645-3a70-48a4-aafe-3c2f3d389864.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

With your support, Oxfam can continue its life-saving work, it can continue to put together packages of food, give farming support, set up foodbanks, support education for women and girls, and provide cash to buy essentials.


For each £15 we raise, were helping more women to understand their rights, challenge discrimination and to take up leadership roles within their local communities.

For each £35, we will ensure families have access to emergency food supplies. 


£45 will provide one of our new handwashing stations to enable frequent handwashing and disease prevention.
