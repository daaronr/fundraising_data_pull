I'm sure most of you are aware of the work they do, but just in case you don't they use their funding and donations made by kind individuals to help in any which way a family may need in times of loss or hardship caused by the C word.</p><p><br></p><p>We , as a family, have suffered with loss of family members and friends over the years and I always wished there was something I could have done to help whichever way I could. In the recent weeks, I have become fortunate enough to build a small community on Twitch, a video game streaming service, and upon seeing an advertisement by MacMillan appealing for gamers to use the resources available to them to use their hobby to try and raise some money for the charity, I instantly signed up and accepted the challenge. I have gamed since the age of 3, it has always been a big part of my life and i thought Ii would be ridiculous for me to not try and do some good and help those who need it most whilst doing what I would probably be doing anyway!

Just before me and my older sister billie called called upstairs into my bedroom and my mum sat us both on my bed she put her arm around both of us and started getting teary at the point me and billie didn’t know why then we found out why. She told us they my grandad had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. This was devastating but it didn’t make my head drop because I knew my grandad was so strong and I always told myself that. Whenever I met my grandad I didn’t treat him any different because of a disease. Once he had started doing chemotherapy after 2 weeks my grandad was rushed into hospital and this got me becoming really emotional just because I didn’t know what was going to happen and if I would see him. As six months passed and my grandad still in hospital my grandad had to get open heart surgery due to a closing valve connecting to his heart. Soon enough my grandad was allowed back home he would always tell me story’s that he had gained whilst in hopsital and the people around him and what they were like and how they kept him up at night this is because I didn’t see him much whilst in hospital but the odd time I would go on a Friday evening after school my mum would take me and billie and we sat in the hospital room and played dominoes his favourite game and he would always beat me. Now at home I was able to go see him a lot more and I would, he was still going to work at select snacks because he wouldn’t give up and I would go to work with him and after work he would let me grab a drink and a snack as his way of paying me for coming to work with him, I was only able to go to work with I’m on the day I stayed the night round there house which one I did I had a really nice time. My grandad every night for tea when I was there wouldn’t even have to ask me what I would want he knew of the top of his head, his homemade Mac and cheese. The nights I would stay round I would always wake up and go in the living room and see him sat that in his arm chair whatching the news in a button up shirt and jeans at six in the morning !!! Sadly once my grandad had finished chemotherapy he lost all his hair and always wore a hat to cover it up even in his house the only times he would take it of was sleeping and showering. My grandad loved his gardening more then anything other then my Nan. But as time went past he became weaker and struggled to get about but this didn’t make him give up. All in his garden he would have bits and bobs to help him do things a lot easier like when he had chicken to stop him having to go in he would send me in, I’m joking he would have a string to pull to let them in and out and grab the eggs they had layed. Even though he was getting weaker and becoming slower at walking and struggling he would always make time for everyone especially me. There’s one memory that will always stay with me and that’s the time he took me darts at the Addison arms pub in glatton we drove in his blue Ford and went in the back half sat down I got a apple and raspberry j2o and he got himself a cider we got the darts out and played he beat me at another thing. Sooner or later his hair grew back and he took his hat off and this meant a lot as it was a massive step for him that he was able to take . After 2 years having cancer my grandad was still winning and was still being able to do his favourite things like going to the pub and gardening. It’s was 1.5 years ago now and I still remeber this strongly, it was a wet Sunday night my mum and dad had gone to the pub with some friends and I was having a really emotional night to the put were I had enough and I ran out my front doors and into the rain and just sat on the curb my nan and grandad then came and got me and my nan went inside and went to check on everyone as billie was baby sitting but my grandad Ill and in pain came and gave me a hug and stood out in the rain with me. He took me round his house that night and he made us fish fingers and chips and beans and we sat in the conservatory and ate on his circular table and ate he tooked to me about my problems and worry’s and put a smile to my face. As time passed to fast my grandad got worse and was back in hospital and we got told his cancer had spread to his spine and paralysed him. The good news was he didn’t have to stay in hospital and he was able to come home so my Nan got their bedroom re done and able for him to stay in and he had a hospital bed a tv and more stuff in there for his needs. Then lockdown happend causing my family unable to see him but eventually we were able to and it was tuff as he was stuck in bed. During lockdown me and my Nan decided to re do there whole garden as it was over grown and mud from the chickens so we did we spent months on it making it grass and open space. Then it was my grandads 70th birthday my whole family went down and sat in the garden and we were able to get my grandad out in his wheel chair and he was able to see his garden never like it was before and he really liked it we also planted flowers out of the front of there garden so my grandad could look out the window and whatch them grow. Now times got tuff as he was taking turns but he was able to over come them all except one which was horrible my grandads legs were in so much pain and so was he until his nurses decided to put him on medicine that what get rid of all of that pain but the side effect was he just slept all day everyday this lasted for 2 weeks and my mum and auntie speant the last two weeks of his life with him. October the 14th, I came home from school and my uncles car was out the front and I knew something was up as I ran in the door and saw my mum and sister crying and my uncle sat there I knew what had happened I instantly went from smiling to my heart had shattered into a million pieces it was devastating and I had lost my grandad. But I remember all the memories I have with him and that’s massive as I don’t think about what I didn’t do with him I think about what I did with him. </p><p>That’s my story with my grandads battle of cancer for 4 years and I want to give back to Macmillan for helping out so much and I would like to give back a little something so if you could please donate even a pound that would mean so much to me :).</p>","Alfie 's  150 miles for Macmillan","0","0","50","50","0","820151","Charlie  Owen ","/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/13536661","remember/820151",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I lost not only a grandma, but genuinely my best friend to this disease, at an age that i could'nt really comprehend it. Cancer, if it has not already will affect most of us in our lives. It is devastating for both the sufferer and their family. Research and funding is really making a difference, and if we can support that further and tell cancer to fuck off, then i am more than happy to be a part of it. Cancer has come back to affect people i know and love since then, but most have give it the middle finger and beat it. For all of you, i want to help. And this is my way of doing it.

On the 20th of September 2013 my Father in Law was also diagnosed with bowel cancer and passed away 13/11/2013. During this super hard period of mine and my family life the guys at McMillan where super hero's. They gave us support, help with sorting out all the little things like getting me on benefits and disability payments. These little things may not seem like much but they made the world of difference back then.

Macmillan was there from the first time mum was diagnosed to introducing us to support groups, helping with treatments &amp; the 100's of worries and questions we had, providing equipment for home and even getting a stair lift installed for us.

This will be a challenge not only to get out the house without 3 children in tow but to have to do it for 10 days in a row. I never really thought about cancer affecting our family until my uncle was diagnosed with it a few years ago and sadly past away from it. And now my beautiful cousin is currently going through chemo to beat it! She’s  an incredibly brave woman and I admire how positive she is.

It has been truly remarkable to see the support St John has provided the NHS so far and how quickly that support was generated.</p><p>In the fight against coronavirus St John Ambulance volunteers are on the frontline, standing alongside our brave NHS. St John urgently need funds to put more first aiders and ambulance crews into communities up and down the country.</p><p><span>St John Ambulance saves lives every day and as we face the extraordinary demands of this ongoing health emergency resources are stretched like never before and we need your support right now.  </span><span>With your help we will continue to support communities after the crisis by training young people and adults to learn lifesaving first aid including the right preparation to ensure our volunteers can help the nation in emergencies whenever they need us. St John also need to keep its fleet on the road and Ambulances need to be replaced and upgraded, this is where you can really help and where my bid to run the next London Marathon will hopefully make a difference.</span></p><p>There has been a long family association with St John with both my Grandfather Jack Petersen, a great boxer in his day, and my father John. It seemed only right for me to try to follow in their footsteps, quite literally in this case!  </p><p>Plans to run the 2020 London Marathon for St John changed somewhat as a result of Covid-19 with the vast majority of runners taking part in a 'virtual event'.  I too took to the streets on a dark, wet and miserable Sunday afternoon to complete the 26.2 miles around the streets of Newbury, sadly without the crowds and atmosphere to distract me from the rain, wind and rather sore feet.  Proudly wearing my St John vest as I made my way around the course it was heartening to see and hear so many people stop, wave, clap and honk their horns in support, thank you one and all!</p><p>Many of you have kindly offered to support me having successfully completed the 2020 virtual event, but now we switch focus to 2021 Marathon and the real fundraising effort begins.  This time, fingers crossed, I will again take to the streets of London, and with<span> the weight of support of the Oxfordshire Priory Group behind me, we hope to raise as much as we can to support the St John emergency campaign.  Raising £10,000 would make a huge difference in the campaign but just imagine if we could raise a whopping £104,000, the cost of a brand new Ambulance! Oh yes, and at the same time, I really must </span><span>beat my rather modest PB of 5 Hrs 11 minutes, surely 5th time lucky!</span></p><p>You no doubt would want to know what impact your donation might make, so here are some examples outlining what specific donation amounts could help fund:</p><p><strong>£100 could help us urgently up-skill and train volunteers.</strong></p><p>Your support could help our many volunteers who need additional training in order to work safely with patients in ambulances, hospitals and in communities during this national emergency. You could also help us to train new volunteers and fast-track them through tailored training courses and continue this work long term.</p><p><strong>£500 could support our volunteer operations to make sure they can respond quickly.</strong></p><p>In this urgent crisis your support could be the difference between a life lost and a life saved. With your help we can make sure our volunteers and staff are connected at all times and are able to respond quickly to a fast-moving situation.</p><p><strong>£1,000+ will support the future of St John Ambulance’s work through COVID-19 and beyond.</strong></p><p>Our role in communities and across the country has never been more vital and with your help we will save lives. Your support will enable us to continue to be the nation’s leading community health and first aid charity.</p><p><strong>£104,000+ will pay for the delivery of a brand new Ambulance to help support St John Ambulance’s work through COVID-19 and beyond.</strong></p><p><strong>St John and COVID-19</strong><br/></p><p>The number of coronavirus cases and deaths in the country continues to rise with significant impact on and stretching of NHS resources. During the COVID-19 outbreak, St John is actively supporting ambulance services, hospitals and communities to protect life and health through this worrying and uncertain period.</p><p>“St John Ambulance is facing extraordinary demands, the likes of which our organisation has not faced in peacetime. Our charity’s resources are being stretched, and our people are being tested, but we will stop at nothing to help beat this virus.” Richard Lee, Chief Operating Officer and COVID Strategic Commander</p><p>Right now, St John is stepping forward to save lives, with thousands of fully trained volunteers. We are supporting the NHS to care for people during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our charity’s vital role responding to the needs of communities across the nation has never been more relevant or urgent.</p><p>St John volunteers are supporting patients right now in the NHS Nightingale Hospital in London, and in hospital emergency departments up and down the country caring for those in need. As more Nightingale hospitals open our volunteers stand ready to do more. Our volunteer ambulance crews are also working 24/7 supporting 999 call outs and transporting recovered patients back home safely.</p><p>So please dig deep, spread the word and let’s do all we can to smash the initial £10,000 target and who knows, perhaps we might even get to the magic £104,000 dream goal! Thank you for anything you can spare and I promise to pull my finger out and make sure my marathon time starts with a 4...!!</p><p>A huge thank you for all your help,</p><p>Matt</p></div><div id=""userStoryReadmore"" class=""collapse"" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"">Read less</div><div id=""display_story_images"" class=""col-sm-12 m-t-16 m-b-8 p-a-0 userGallery"" style=""float: left;width: 670px;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);""></div><div id=""shareMyStory"" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51);""><div class=""m-b-36""></div></div><p></p>","Matt's page","12.50","0","50","1","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Virtual London Marathon 2020","https://images.justgiving.com/image/213b1cb5-2fab-43eb-804c-953fc4484134.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true",NA,"https://images.justgiving.com/image/213b1cb5-2fab-43eb-804c-953fc4484134.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The treatment he received from the health service, both </span><span>here and in Madeira where he and our Mum spent their holidays, enabled him to </span><span>have a long, happy and active retirement. He loved sailing, particularly in </span><span>Pembrokeshire where he and our Mum lived for 25 years, and was a member of </span><span>Pembroke Haven Yacht Club, including a term as Commodore; he was also an active </span><span>member of Tenby Golf Club, taking on the role of Club Captain for a while; and </span><span>he and our Mum would walk for miles along the levadas when on their holidays in </span><span>Madeira.</span></p><p><span>When Mum and Dad moved to Herefordshire in later years, both </span><span>became enthusiastic regulars at the local BHF cardiac rehabilitation keep fit </span><span>classes, and Dad carried on playing at Dymock Golf Club up until about 3 years </span><span>ago, not long before his 90</span><sup>th</sup><span> birthday!</span></p><p>We hope that your donation to the British Heart Foundation will enable others to live their lives to the full after cardiac surgery in the way that our Dad did.

The coronavirus pandemic is the biggest challenge the BHF has faced in their 60-year history.

While the world has been on lockdown, heart and circulatory diseases havent. Theyve still been tearing families apart, ending lives too soon and snatching away peoples quality of life. They are still the worlds biggest killers and no matter what else is happening, Research has helped the BHF gain so much ground over the last few decades, and its the only way they are going to get to the finish line. 

We want to raise funds to support research at Welsh universities, so no one has to go through the heartbreak of losing someone to this awful disease.

His death left seismic waves not only in our family's lives but in every life he touched. He was truly 'one of a kind' and I am not shy to say, the best doctor I have ever had the privilege to meet - he was my inspiration. </p><p>My Dad had significant struggles with his own personal health having had a quadruple bypass at Bart's in 1987, I was 5 years old, my sister 10. I remember those long drives to London from Southend with my mum and sister, visiting Dad while he was recovering, which in itself was turbulent to say the least.</p><p>You wouldn't have known this about my Dad as he was not one to let difficulties stop him or get the better of him. Instead, challenges were his driving force and he continued to be a successful single-handed award winning GP. </p><p><!--StartFragment--><span style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);float: none;"">For as long as I can remember, my Dad woke up at 5.30am everyday and ran 5 miles, which was followed by weight training. He did this every day, before taking me to school and then doing a full surgery of 35 patients, his day would also include home visits and at least one care home or nursing home visits too. He somehow managed to fit in picking me up from school in his 'lunch hour' before heading back to work - I have no idea how he managed this... but he did this so well and always with a smile on his face and a joke or two to tell!  </span><!--EndFragment--><br/><br/><span style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);float: none;""><span style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);float: none;"">My Dad and Mum mum raised money annually for local hospital charities where my Dad had the opportunity to partake in his favourite hobby.... singing. He was a wonderful and dedicated singer, again diligently practising this art daily. He made life look 'easy', because I think he had this mindset and perspective. <span style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);float: none;"">Those who knew him never knew what he endured because he saw the the bright side of life and saw struggles as the making of us. This is a teaching I hold on to, especially in these very difficult times we are living in.  </span><!--EndFragment--><br/></span></span><br/><!--StartFragment--><span style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);float: none;"">Unfortunately, my Dad was  unable to tolerate 'innovative' procedures in 2005 which ultimately led to his untimely departure in January 2006, just 5 months later.</span></p><p>So, why am I running 5km?</p><p>5km for some is 'easy-peasy' and if my younger self could speak to me now, I'm sure I would be having some stern words about the deconditioned state I am in! </p><p>Having had several physical health set backs, I have been unable to keep on 'tip-top' form, but now, my pledge to my father, as it is coming up to the 15th anniversary of his passing, is to look after myself, just as he looked after himself so diligently. His physical activity is what kept him alive for 18 years following his bypass. <span>If he had no excuse, then I certainly don't. </span></p><p><span>Along with my sister, we've decided to do the the couch to 5km over the next 9 weeks to align with my dad's anniversary on 17.1.21. So, on 17.1.21 we will be able to do the a full 5km without stopping.

The Coronavirus Pandemic this year has significantly impacted the monies being donated to these worthwhile charities - money that is desperately needed to continue research and support functions of those charities.

Therefore the PENTEN and OITC teams have proposed a ""Virtual"" event where people may take part on the same day but in their own time whilst maintaining social distancing rules

OCD shift workers may also choose a different day to take part

Therefore for 2020 we will be raising money for the British Heart Foundation There is a choice of three events - indoor or outdoor

Cycling

Challenge 1 - Minimum 20 miles

Challenge 2 - Minimum 50 miles

Running

Challenge 1 - Minimum 5K

Challenge 2 - Minimum 10K

Walking

Challenge 1 - Minimum 5K

Challenge 2 - Minimum 10K

The event will take part on the 28th November 2020

So please join the Team and raise money as much money as possible for an extremely worthwhile cause

There is a small joining fee of £10 which of course will go towards the total raised.

So please register and Join in have fun and support a worthy cause!!!

Virtual fundraising challenges like Dechox are a way to help us keep up the pace of progress. Your willpower will be funnelled into groundbreaking science and support for the people who need us most.

You could complete 100 metres, 100 minutes, 100 days  be creative!

The sponsorship money you raise will make a difference. £100 could pay for five hours' training at a Guide Dogs training school.

During December hundreds of our fundraising dogs across the UK would usually be out and about wagging their tails and meeting you at supermarket and street collections, Christmas fairs and festive coffee mornings. Our four-legged fundraisers support the 400+ fundraising groups across the UK from Glasgow to Plymouth and everywhere in between.

At first I didn't think I needed a guide dog, I guess I was in denial about how much my sight had deteriorated. However a bad experience at Epsom races changed my attitude. It was supposed to be a fun day out with the family but the huge crowds made me really anxious. We ended up leaving early becuase I couldn't cope and thought I was going to walk into everyone. For weeks afterwards I felt low and socially I didn't feel comfortable.</span></p><p><span>I admitted to myself that I needed some help, and a<span style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);float: none;"">fter a chat with Brenda</span> we decided to contact Guide Dogs. The support I recieved during the application process alone made a huge difference. While waiting on a guide dog I recieved long cane training which helped me </span><span>recover my independence and </span><span>taught me numerous skills to enable me to get out and about safely despite my </span><span>loss of vision.</span><span>  </span><span>I am hugely grateful to the Newcastle Guide Dogs team who</span><span> helped me to accept my sight loss and who gave me the </span><span>skills and confidence to get out and about again and live life without limits.</span></p><p><span>In 2017 I was matched to my guide dog Hannah, a yellow Labrador, and we bonded immediately! Hannah has made an incredible difference to my life. Since qualifying she has enabled me to travel across the country to visit friends and family, and <span style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);float: none;"">to various fundraising events for Guide Dogs. She has even helped me navigate the busy streets of London, which was unimaginable before. I've written a book about my life and experience of sight loss, and became a fundraising volunteer and speaker for Guide Dogs to raise awareness of their work and to help other people who have lost their sight. <span style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);float: none;"">Sight<span> </span></span><span style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);float: none;"">loss has been life changing, but so is Hannah!</span></span></span></p><p><span>Help Guide Dogs raise enough funds this Christmas to fund 12 new guide dog partnerships.

Our new Never Far Away: Essex Appeal aims to raise vital funds to support parent and family accommodation at GOSH. £300,000 will give families precious nights close to their children whilst they receive treatment at GOSH. We are asking the people of Essex to get behind this appeal, together we can make a massive difference to the families who are going through a very stressful time, if we can ease one worry then it is worth it. Whether you can raise £1 or £100; it will make an impact to so many families. A 7-night stay for 2 adults in a budget hotel 15 minutes from the hospital would cost a staggering £815. This is simply not affordable for most families.Find out more at www.gosh.org/NeverFarAway </p><p>At Basking Babies we’ve been running events to raise money for this vital appeal for the past couple of years and did not want multiple lockdowns during 2020 to stop us! </p><p>During the month of December we’ll be asking mums to dress up their babies in something Christmassy across all our Baby Massage and Baby Yoga classes in Essex.

Without this fantastic hospital my little Daisy wouldn't be here now. Daisy had 2 open heart surgeries at GOSH in 2015 to fix 3 holes in her heart. Her first surgery was an emergency operation to attached PA band around one of her artery's to slow to flow of blood pumping into her lungs, Because her lungs were getting too much fluid she found breathing very difficult and a lot of the time she needed extra oxygen to help her breath. <br />The second surgery was in November 2015 to fill her hole in her heart. this was a complete success and she has been able to live a normal happy childhood ever since<br /><br />This January, I'm kickstarting 2021 by taking part in Running off Christmas. the challenge is to run 31 miles in 31 days however i have set myself the challenge to run 93 miles in 31 days to raise money for Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity (GOSH Charity).

I'm hoping to raise as much money as I can for them, as a token of my appreciation for what they done, and continue to do for him. I know times are tough and money is tight, but if you could spare anything, no matter how big or small, it would be a huge help towards my target. In the words of Tesco 'Every Little Helps'.

It wasn't until a year later and several trips to the hospital that the issues were finally diagnosed.</p><p>At three years old I was old enough to be operated on and my parents were able to get me referred to GOSH. I underwent several operations to clear my nose and a complex operation that fed a tiny coil from my thigh, through my heart and dropped at a point that forced the blood flow through my lungs.</p><p>Compared to the other incredible operations and work that everyone at GOSH does, these can seem like minor pieces of work. However, these operations changed my life and I will always be grateful. With my parents supporting GOSH every year I finally wanted to do my part to support them. I hope you can join me in supporting them by contributing to the amazing work they do.</p>","Brighton Marathon - Fundraising for GOSH","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Scary as this is the same happened to  Matthew our Transport Manager who lost his dad in a 5 weeks time frame.  It was a wake up call for me that Cancer can take people so quickly , some thing that I had no previous comprehension of . 

Part of CV19 lock down encouraged all of the team at Rexel Leeds to get fit a challenge that they succeeded in losing a combined 10 Stone in 13 weeks.

Because the team are still in there top physical peak ...........well kind of!!!  I have challenged my work colleagues to travel the distance from Rexel Leeds to Mums old house in Altea Spain  starting  1st of December through to the 18th of December .

It is now time for me to begin a new chapter, with mixed emotions. I am currently training for an exciting new role in schools, as a School Business Manager which will be completed in January 2022; my own business finally has a full-time MD but overshadowing this exciting time, is my incredible father, Rev. Philip Auden DL MNM, who is fighting his way with terminal cancer and has only months to live. My Dad and I have been through so much together, more than most fathers and sons I'd say, and I feel it is my duty to be with him at this time. My Mum also succumbed to this horrible disease at a relatively early age and I know in talking to you, the glorious parents over the years, some of you have your own life experiences with this wretched disease. I have been supporting  Cancer Research for many years and I feel the greater the opportunity they have to find those elusive cures, the brighter the future will look.  My target, represents ten pounds for each year I have been associated with Bowbrook (try and work that one out...) plus of course, 300 is a special number for me, for the eagle-eyed car- spotters amongst you. </p><p>THANK YOU (a big thank you...) to my awesome colleagues, my many friends, to your fabulous children, to you the parents (past and present) for making my journey at Bowbrook incredibly memorable, and one special, heartfelt thank you to Mr and Mrs Allen, without whom none of this, in fact any of it, would be possible for any of us!

He underwent major operations and received intensive chemo and radiotherapy treatment. He made a remarkable recovery and was able to enjoy and get on with his life. <br/><br/>Sadly, in September 2019 he was informed he had developed secondary anal cancer. He made the decision to have an intense course of radiotherapy which really took its toll on him. He slowly began to improve and seemed to be getting stronger but over Christmas/New Year 2019 he became unwell. He had a DVT and had also developed an infection. <br/><br/>On January 16th I sat with Dad and Chriss (his Wife) while Doctors discussed his future treatment. The prognosis was not good, the cancer was spreading and the infection had taken hold. Dad made the extremely brave decision to decline any further treatment.

She has seen first hand the difference the hospice makes to so many patients. This Christmas,  Marie Curie need local businesses and people to donate anything they can to help people with terminal illnesses. Every single day at the hospice is an extraordinary day. And every moment is precious. The hospice nurses, doctors and therapists provide the best possible care for people with serious illnesses, and offer vital emotional support for them and their families. The hospice is a warm, welcoming place where loved ones can be together in peaceful surroundings and in as much comfort as possible. Whether it's for one day or several weeks, the time people spend at the hospice is precious, and is cherished by them and their families.</p><p><b style=""color: rgb(117, 117, 117);""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 114, 196);"">Know the impact of your donations.

And we help the nation prepare for death, to help makes things better at the end.<br/><br/>Last year we helped more than 60,000 people directly and reached over two million more. Marie Curie Nurses care for people in their homes,<br/>giving much-needed respite to overstretched carers. Our nine hospices offer the reassurance of specialist care and support in a friendly, welcoming environment – so people can feel safe and cared-for in their final months, weeks and days of life. Our trusted information and support line help people in their hour of need to feel reassured, informed and empowered to face what’s happening in their lives.

All with the aim of helping the work of the amazing <b>Marie Curie Foundation</b>. </p><p>Having spent the past two years of Sixth Form volunteering at a care home close to my school, it taught me to appreciate the work that foundations such as Marie Curie are able to achieve. Marie Curie is able to provide frontline nursing and hospice care, a free support line and a wealth of information and support on all aspects of dying, death and bereavement. The money which is raised will go directly to caring services, research and campaigning for better end of life care. Remember every penny counts!</p><p>There is no better way for me to fundraise, than a trek. Since I can remember my mum has been telling me stories of the adventures she had and in 2016, we walked over 300 miles for the World Land Trust, but this time I am going bigger and better. I am super excited to tackle this incredible mountain and any contributions to the work of Marie Curie we can gather in the process will be greatly appreciated!</p><p>To keep up with my fundraising efforts and adventures please do keep an eye on this page as well as follow my instagram <b>@adventures4mariecurie</b>.</p><p><b><u>Thank you again for all your generous support! </u></b></p><p>Lots of Love</p><p>Bella xoxo</p>","Bella's Kilimanjaro Trek","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"true",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Every single day at the hospice is an extraordinary day. 

We listen, support and give high-quality care during what can be a difficult, challenging and distressing time. And we get to know people as individuals, find out what makes them happy, and help to make those things happen.

That might mean sitting with them in the hospice garden, or arranging for their pet to visit them at the hospice. We focus on the special things that bring people joy.

We also provide important support for carers and families, including bereavement support and counselling.

We need to raise £6,150 per day to run the hospice, so every penny counts. Thank you for helping to make sure more people with a terminal illness in and around Belfast, get the care and support they need.

She was the most amazing mam, daughter, sister, grandma and friend to so many people who loved her very much. Linda only spent 8 days in the Marie Curie Hospice in Newcastle where she received the most amazing love and care from every staff member, who also gave us, the family and friends unbelievable support. We will never be able to say how thankful we are for the nurses at Marie Curie and the amount of care they gave to us. </p><p>Due to this year being as terrible as everyone knows it has been, the hospice’s have suffered hugely with running costs which is so sad to hear because every family and individual deserves the support that we were given and will be forever grateful for. This year Marie Curie have a ‘Light up Christmas’ campaign, where if £100 is raised for the charity then they will light up a personalised lantern in remembrance of your lost loved one. Raising that amount of money for such an amazing, helpful charity and being able to have a remembrance lantern shining on Christmas eve, where she gained her wings, would mean the absolute world to us. She is missed more and more  every day<U+2764><U+FE0F></p><p>Thank you so much for reading and thank you even more for donating if you have it means so much to us. 24hour End of life care is so unexpected, but so important that it is well funded so all of our loved ones can continue to gain their wings with the same care my grandma received. </p>","Rebecca's page","45","0","315","315","0","820276","Linda Kennedy","/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/13538627","remember/820276","Linda Kennedy",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This is a challenge faced daily for approximately 11.3% of the world's population including children. Every minute, more than five child mortalities can be attributed to malnutrition. For those fortunate to survive, malnutrition has detrimental effects on childhood growth and learning abilities.

It was these qualities that brought four musicians, an artist and a sound mixing engineer together in a group project through lockdown to create a song to raise funds for Medecins Sans Frontieres,  to help the worlds most vulnerable people at this time.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span style=""color: #000000;background-color: transparent;"">It is a time of global uncertainty, sickness, death, poverty and despair but our human qualities of kindness, resilience, creativity and collective problem solving will be what sees us through. </span></p><p><br/></p><p dir=""ltr""><span style=""color: #000000;background-color: transparent;"">I, the singer songwriter was inspired by the image of a prayer flag which is used to send blessings around the world.  I reckoned that a song works in much the same way so I wrote this song for people to join in the chorus and send collective blessings for healing around the world. By turning it into a video with a donate button it then allows people to help in practical ways too. A dual experience of helping and the action of singing together around the world unites us as a global human family, as ‘we are in it together” and solutions to all the associated corona problems will be addressed more effectively if we can remember this shared humanity.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span style=""color: #000000;background-color: transparent;"">Creating the song long distance was not without its problems - lack of experience and poor equipment meant there were many hurdles to overcome-  recorded bird song, backfiring motorbikes, an ill tuned recorder to name but a few! The beautiful cover artwork was done as a bespoke project by artist Yuni Ko, in Canada. Three of the musicians and engineer live in  and around London but could not meet up and I the singer songwriter live in North East Scotland. Many of us had never met so the whole project relied on digital communication and the commonly held wish that holds this project together.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span style=""color: #000000;background-color: transparent;"">Once it was finished it took weeks to get it through copyright as everyone at the agency was furloughed and there was no one available to answer questions. Finally, the song was ready to launch and Medecins sans Frontieres felt like a good fit as a charitable home for the song. They work across all countries in the places that need it the most for people who need it the most. It is the worlds most vulnerable that need the most help and so we hope that this song for a good cause will contribute in raising funds for their tireless efforts in helping people.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span style=""color: #000000;background-color: transparent;"">As the song's creators, we have decided to set up a band as a result of working on this song together. We are calling the band Karuna, which is Sanskrit for compassion. It feels an apt name for a band that is born out of this crazy time and a wonderful piece of creativity at an otherwise fairly barren time. We will work together around the nucleus of my other songs and will start by creating a song cycle inspired by this time called “Songs for Our Time.’ Our new band logo is another piece of artwork by Yuni Ko alongside the cover artwork for the song. </span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span style=""color: #000000;background-color: transparent;"">I have called the song “Heartsease” as it is my wish for our hearts to have a little collective healing and peace through joining in the song.
