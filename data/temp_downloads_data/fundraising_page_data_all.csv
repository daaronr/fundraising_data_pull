She had three stents fitted but unfortunately her heart is still only pumping at 31%. Naturally she gets tired very easily.  Every daily chore is an effort but  she is always smiling and making light of her situation. She has to as she had a young family aged six and eight. The British Heart Foundation have been amazing with her rehab until lockdown but despite that, they  keep in contact with her on a regular basis by telephone. The support and encouragement she draws from them is what keeps her going. <b>They need as much funding as they can get.</b> </span></p><p><font color=""#000000""><span>At Easter time my </span>fiancé<span> was rushed to hospital and was diagnosed with arterial fibrillation. </span></font></p><p><font color=""#000000""><span>These events to my loved ones made me put things into perspective and I realised I needed to change my lifestyle or I could be the next one! When asked what I wanted for my 60th birthday the obvious answer seemed to be a treadmill!  It was my intention to ensure my minimum steps were carried out on a daily basis especially on those more sedate days when I was sat in the office. However after a couple of weeks it got boring and I felt I needed to do something which would be a challenge and I could see an improvement into my exercise regime. NHS couch to 5K was the obvious choice. It is a nine week program at the end of which you should be able to jog/run for 30 minutes. I have currently just finished week six and being able to jog for 25 minutes I am now officially a runner. &#128578;&#128077;The next three weeks are the hardest but I aim to keep going until I graduate - 3 consecutive runs at 30 minutes each. When I saw this challenge it was like a light bulb moment inside my head – is this what I have been training for. I don’t think I’ll ever cover 5K but 100 K in 36 days is hopefully doable. I would like to raise a minimum of £250 to go towards this wonderful charity. It would be nice to add an extra “0” to the end of that but knowing the difficult year everybody has had any contribution would be more than appreciated. <b>I would like to thank you for your generosity, I hope you and your families all stay safe and well and that you will never need the services of the British Heart Foundation.</b></span></font></p><p><br/><br/></p>","Andrea’s page","30","0","220","88","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"https://images.justgiving.com/image/73002f32-b559-4617-a36e-511f4490aff6.jpg","https://images.justgiving.com/image/73002f32-b559-4617-a36e-511f4490aff6.jpg?template=size150x150face","f6804d52-e283-46e1-a4c6-9636f9d29d45","gothedistance100k","https://images.justgiving.com/image/ab71be04-c661-4bba-89a2-de02029e52a5.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true","https://images.justgiving.com/image/ab71be04-c661-4bba-89a2-de02029e52a5.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true",NA,NA,NA,NA
