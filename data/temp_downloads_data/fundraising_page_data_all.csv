So it's the most efficient way to donate - saving time and cutting costs.</p><p>Nothing can prepare you and your loved ones for the such a potentially life changing event as a diagnosis of cancer or other critical health condition but there are things that you can and should put in place now to support you and you family; from the onset of symptoms through to diagnosis and treatment; as well as providing the peace of mind that your families future financial security is assured. <br/><br/>I am so grateful that I took heed of this advice (mostly!) a few years ago as it gives me great comfort to know that these boringly practical but vitally important elements have been taken care of, as I just cannot imagine trying to deal with these matters in the midst of emotional armageddon. <br/><br/>Private Health Insurance – I cannot stress enough how beneficial private health cover can be in ensuring an early diagnosis of a potentially life changing condition. Unfortunately, having enjoyed this benefit during my executive career, I did not retain this once I became self employed. As a consequence, it took almost 12 weeks from the onset of symptoms and an incorrect diagnosis of cracked ribs, muscle strain, muscle tear, wind and even pleurisy before eventually being granted the all-important CT scan that revealed the cancer and allowed treatment to begin. - If your employer offers it, take it; if they do not, seriously consider funding it yourself (if able).<br/><br/>Life Insurance/Critical Illness Cover - I am guessing that most of you will/should have life insurance policies in place that will help soften the financial burden for you family if the unthinkable happens? However, advances in medical science have thankfully resulted in much improved survival rates for many illnesses that were previously fatal. In this case, critical illness cover can provide much needed financial support when you are no longer able to work and provide for your family! - Like all insurance, it’s not needed until you need it and although expensive, it buys peace of mind!<br/><br/>Retain a Financial Advisor – Often in a relationship one party (husband, wife, partner) takes care of the majority of financial, legal and insurance matters, often without the involvement or understanding of the other. If the unthinkable happens, would you or your partner know what savings accounts, insurance policies, pension etc are in place and where to access all the documents/information? I would strongly recommend retaining the services of a trusted financial advisor that you both like and have complete confidence in; someone who gets to know your family, its wishes and aspirations and is fully conversant and involved with your financial planning and protection. For a number of years, I have retained and can thoroughly recommend Chris.Bull@kelland.co.uk who has always provided good counsel and has been an absolute rock during the past couple of weeks in dealing with any financial concerns.<br/><br/>Get a Will in Place– My wife and I avoided this subject for years but, after good advice, put one in place earlier this year thereby, thankfully, avoiding being forced to address this now. - I strongly suggest that, if you do not have one in place, do so NOW. A basic Will is not expensive and can be drafted via most local solicitors, but if you need something more complex involving Family Trusts or Powers of Attorney then seek more specialist advice. We used and can recommend Paul.Clark@spallclark.co.uk<br/><br/>Death in Service Benefit – Not usually top of the list when negotiating your remuneration package with a potential new employer and my guess is that many of you will not actually know your current entitlement without checking first! This can provide the peace of mind in knowing that if the unthinkable happens, your family will at least have a degree of financial security. Again, it’s not that expensive for your employer to increase your cover and when it’s time for your annual pay review, why not suggest an increase in the DiS multiple rather than increasing your basic pay or even take a salary sacrifice to help pay for the increased premium.<br/><br/><br/>We all think we are invincible, and it happens to other people, so we put off making these types of decisions on the basis that’s its expensive, not required or I will sort it later. In reality it can and probably will happen to many of you or your loved ones (sorry!) and I seriously urge you to ‘plan for the worst but hope for the best’ in relation to planning for the future.<br/><br/>If this advice now prompts you into taking action then it’s been extremely worthwhile and all I ask in return is that you take time to reflect what is REALLY important in your life and to treasure/protect it as you never know what’s around the corner …………..and maybe ask you all to make a donation to Macmillan Cancer Support charity through my just Giving page <br/><br/>Also, If you are prompted to take out life insurance, critical health cover, private health, make a will or appoint a financial advisor, please ask the companies involved to also make a contribution </p>","David's Fund Raising","5","0","20","2","0","true","true",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Hi everyone, I am taking part in a sponsored gaming marathon to raise money for people living with cancer. My mum is the strongest person I know and she has shown me this year how difficult it can be dealing with cancer. Whether its the constant appointments, the side effects of chemotherapy, the raw, burnt skin from radiotherapy or even just the emotional stress while everyone around seems to just carry on as normal. I hope I can raise a bit of awareness about the difficulties of living with Cancer.</p>","David ODonovan ","0","0","0","0","0","true","true",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"53922849-6e69-4322-addb-a2b7a21e32e5",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There is nobody to come and take over so I can have a break.  Through all of this GOSH make it easier.  They listen to everything we have to say and always take my opinions on board as his Mum, they make Charlie feel as relaxed as possible, making him feel like the superstar he is.
