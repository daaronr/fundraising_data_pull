St John volunteers treat and transport thousands of patients each year, and in times of crisis we are England's national health reserve.  

During the pandemic our skilled and highly trained volunteers are working long shifts supporting sick people and their families, in hospitals, in ambulances and at home. We are proud to be working alongside the nations ambulance trusts and in hospitals around the country.

During December hundreds of our fundraising dogs across the UK would usually be out and about wagging their tails and meeting you at supermarket and street collections, Christmas fairs and festive coffee mornings. Our four-legged fundraisers support the 400+ fundraising groups across the UK from Glasgow to Plymouth and everywhere in between.

Due to the current situation, most of our fundraising groups will not be out collecting this festive season, and our four-legged fundraisers will be very much missed! We hope you will do your bit and help us as we aim to raise enough for 12 new guide dog partnerships! Heres how you can join in:

With sitting constantly at a desk, then the sofa in front of the TV at night during Covid I feel my body has now started to rust, so therefore I wanted to set a challenge to motivate me to get moving again, and also stop me eating all the Christmas food in the house! </p><p>My friend Rachael was due to run the London landmarks half marathon 2020 but due to Covid it was delayed until May 2021. She will claim she had no part in this, but having planted the seed saying you can run in fancy dress and they provide the suit… After careful consideration (all of 5 minutes) knowing I currently can’t run more than 2 miles without stopping and needing help putting on my socks the next day, I foolishly signed up! </p><p>Now 13 miles might not seem far for most, I know a lot of people who run this distance every week if not more, but this is far for me! It’s fair to say the only time you will ever see me smiling while running is when I’m chasing after the ice-cream van for my 99er.</p><p><span>I will be running for guide dogs and will be dressed as a big dog. I’m hoping (and aware I sound like the TV adverts) if everyone can spare just £1, I should be able hit my minimum target. And I really am hoping to hit this target because I didn’t bother reading the small print!</span><br/></p><p>Every hour, another person in the UK goes blind. Almost two million people in the UK are living with sight loss, and 180,000 of those rarely leave their home alone. This charity relies on our donations to continue their life-changing work. Every pound raised does make a difference to people in the UK. My sponsorship will help sponsor puppies from 6 weeks to becoming a fully-qualified guide dog after 24 months of training, and will help give freedom and independence to people with sight loss. </p><p>I started my couch to 5k yesterday (14/12/20), and will continue my training up to April to ensure I do not let you or the charity down, and please don’t worry if you see me running down the street in my onesie<br/>come March 2021, I’m ok and just training / preparing for the extra costume weight, I’ve not lost my mind… </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);float: none;"">I understand the past year has been incredibly hard financially for everyone and I’m conscious of my timing.

This coming summer, I will be climbing Mt Kilimanjaro. A group of university students, and myself, have decided to embark on this journey to raise funds for the Marie Curie Foundation. </p><p>Marie Curie specializes in end of life charity. They provide nursing and hospice care, a free support line and information to help those dealing with death. During these hard times, Marie Curie Nurses have been on the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic. They have continued to provide care to people living with terminal illness as well as their family members. By supporting this fundraiser in any way, you are making a difference by paying for a nurse to care for a person in need. </p><p>Thank you to everyone for the support!

RNLI lifeboats in Northern Ireland protect hundreds of communities through our 24-hour search and rescue service. They rely on the safest, most reliable lifeboats and modern stations to launch from. The RNLI relies on donations from you to continue saving lives at sea and on inland waters - your donation to this page will help support the running of lifeboat stations in Northern Ireland.<br/>So this year.......a different life as we know it, wearing masks, washing hands every two minutes, social distancing and no hugs &#128552; But, we have to do our best to look after everyone and keep doing it for as long as is needed. The Turkey Trot will most definitely be happening in 2020 but it too will be different. No big crowds, no indoor tea and cake afterwards, no team runs but  my individual trots. Still there, but different. So I need a good cause. <br/>Most people know that I love a swim in the sea and thankfully it is one activity we have been allowed to continue. I gain so much from being in the water, it hashelped so much with my grief, lonliness reduce stress, helps me sleep, it is exhilarating and makes me happy and you'll always hear me in the water singing.. I feel better inside and out because of it.  This summer our local beaches were unbelievably busy and there are a group of people I am so grateful to for looking out for us in the water, the RNLI Lifeguards. This summer they made an unprecedented number of rescues on a daily basis, difficult under normal circumstances but made even more complicated while trying to maintain all the COVID-19 measures. I am so grateful to them and that is why I would love to make the @RNLI Livesavers Fund Northern Ireland my chosen charity for my Turkey Trot donation this year.</p><p>Thank You So Much.</p><p>Fiona Turkey Trotter.</p>","RNLI Northern Ireland  Lifesavers Fund","2.50","0","10","20","0","PersonalRunning_Marathons",NA,NA,NA,NA,"I am running 3 Miles every day in December 2020 because The sea has been my therapist","I am running 3 Miles every day in December 2020","The sea has been my therapist",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"a9585744-f4fc-420f-9fe2-adb4e2ef49fc",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I also included a professional flat aluminium nose wire which can be removed. This makes them more suitable for people wearing specs, turbans, headscarfs, hearing aids etc...<br/></p><p> I had started sewing masks for family and friends and made gifts to some colleagues, who liked them so much that they ordered more off me to pass on to their friends. Interest grew and some of my masks have since also been sold via a few local businesses for £10-12 each. This allowed me to recuperate the cost for and buy additional materials and expand the project and range of designs and my aim now is to raise money for MSF by &#34;selling&#34; masks via donataions through this website. <br/></p><p>Please help me raise funds for MSF by &#34;buying&#34; one of my masks via making a donation on this site. All the proceeds will go directly to MSF if you donate thought this site. For those who cannot collect the mask in person, I will happily post out to you within the UK and EU.<br/></p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.
