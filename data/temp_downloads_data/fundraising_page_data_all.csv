This initiative was something we had planned to do in partnership with Hannah.

The hat and drum that feature in the shoot were made by Buttercup Bus, and we have decided to raffle these hand crafted, unique items (now with a little glitter on them from the shoot - ha ha!) in order to raise money for a charity that will resonate with both Hannah and the team at Buttercup Bus. </p><p>Please buy a ticket for just £5, to help raise money for Cancer Research UK. Your ticket will be put in a glittery hat, and drawn at random on 30th November 2020. The lucky winner will get both the hat and the drum posted to them.</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure. Your details are safe with JustGiving - they'll never sell them on or send unwanted emails. Once you donate, they'll send your money directly to the charity.

You can buy as many tickets as you like, for multiple entries into the shoot. Each ticket is £5 to enter. Similar style hand  crafted hats range from £50-£150 on Etsy. The drum is so unique that we could not find an equivalent to value. They both feature in the header picture, taken by Tony Pullen Photography.
