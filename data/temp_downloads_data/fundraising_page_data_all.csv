For those who know me, each year i raise money for various charities and this year I am holding a Macmillan Coffee morning on Sunday 4th Oct (yes in the rain!) But the reason I'm holding it is because I am hearing more and more of my family and friends being diagnosed with this dreadful disease and want to do my bit to raise awareness. So, if everyone could donate just £1, then i will soon be on my way to achieving my target and enabling Macmillan to provide physical, financial and emotional support to those who very much need it.</p><p>Today (Saturday) I will be baking various cakes and treats to sell, so if anyone is local to me then it would be amazing for you to pop along for a piece of cake and a cuppa. To enable us to meet social distancing restrictions, it will be held outside, but we have a Gazeebo &#128522; (I will get mom to put the details on facebook) Thank you all.

She has been learning about the plight of children having to travel for miles to find water which isn’t always safe and can make them very unwell. With this in mind she has decided that she would like to raise some money by swimming 100 metres. She has thought of doing this all by herself and really wants to make a difference. She would be very grateful for any support as she takes on her swimming challenge. Many thanks for any donations. </p><p><span>Clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene should be a normal part of everyone’s daily life.

They have a lack of basic healthcare, severe food shortages and limited clean water. </span></p><p><span>It caught my attention on BBC news, when it was finally covered how devastating some peoples lives are in Yemen. Yemen is suffering from one of the world's worst humanitarian crisis. It hurts to think we have stores and stores full of food in the UK and so much wastage, where a mere fraction would be so useful to supporting the other side of the world. It is so sad to think that 85,000 </span>children<span> under 5 have died from starvation!</span></p><p><span>We know how devastating Covid-19 has been on our day to day lives and just think, how Yemen would have felt, when they already had the pressure of war and famine to deal with. </span><span><br/></span></p><p><span>I have made this page in hope of raising funds to </span>contribute<span> towards Yemen's famine crisis. If any of you have little nephews, nieces, sons and daughters, please empathise with the many mothers who are scared of losing their children. Please donate what you can - whether it be £3, £5 or £10 and so on towards a cause you know are serving the helpless. I would appreciate it! </span></p><p>I will be donating £40 to CARE and in addition will be meeting targets of my own. I have recently got back into running after a chronic injury and want to get better timings running around my local park and will be reporting these times. I also have always been interested and protective of society's minorities that are disadvantaged - whether that be mental health, physical disability and people with impairments. The minority I want to focus on, are deaf people and how sign language is not commonly known. I do feel deaf people are outcasted by society, where little effort is made to accommodate them . So I will be learning 20 sign language phrases, in addition to the alphabet, and will be posting these learnings on social media. </p><p>Here's a little more about CARE...</p><p><span> CARE is focused on helping the most vulnerable people, through distributing food to families in need, and cash vouchers so that families can purchase for themselves the food they need. Over a year of fighting and fuel shortages has destroyed water pipes and water pumping facilities, so CARE is rehabilitating water sources and providing water tanks so women and children can get safe drinking water without having to travel long distances. CARE is also providing hygiene kits, paying special attention to womens and children's needs.Thank you for reading.
