During his time in hospital at the heart and lung hospital in London back in Jan 2016 was that there are a whole array of lung diseases and unfortunately they said there was nothing that they could do for him as too much water had entered his lungs - there was nothing I could do to shield him from that news and Drs had given us a timer on his life. I wish things were done differently and I wish he was treated as high priority because a life is a life.</p><p>Anyone who’s lost their loved ones due to this pandemic my heart goes out to you! This Pandemic has opened my eyes on a whole new level! I pray that we’re all protected from this vicious disease!</p><p>I know deep down my Daddy wouldn’t have survived COVID if he caught it! I wish I had done more for him and known more about these awful diseases! He was a fighter and he went on until the very end he walked until his body could no longer walk! He was my rock and always tried to keep me in my best health because of what he went through! I want to make him proud!</p><p>I will be giving up chocolate for a whole month! Even he knew how much of a chocoholic I was and my close family and friends know how much I’m obsessed with anything chocolate! Moving forward- I can do this for him, myself and my children!

Throughout his life he participated in lots of charity work including running the London Marathon which I was very proud to watch. So, in honour of my Dad, a few of my closest friends and I will be running the Dorney Half Marathon in March to raise money for the British Heart Foundation.

Dig deep and share my page.  This year, this appeal means more than ever, without our Frontline Workers, how would we even have a glimmer of hope to survive?  Covid 19 is a disease too close to home where many of us have been affected through severe illness and loss.   My family and I have been truly affected both by Covid 19 and cancer over the last year. Without the vital help of the nurses and frontline staff. many people would not get the aupport they need.  Thank you so much for choosing to support our vital work.

He was the king of the family and was deeply loved by us all.

Pa loved being on boats and in his lifetime he had a number of them, us kids loved being on the boats with Pa from fishing to jumping into the sea and taking us to Lifeboat Bay when we didn’t want to walk. He was also the chairman of the local RNLI, a charity close to his heart.</span></p><p class=""p1"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><span>With this in mind, I put my head together with my brother, Liam, we thought why not raise some money for the RNLI in memory of Pa. We thought why not walk the distance from Nan and Pa’s abode in Lichfield to their holiday home in Morfa Nefyn in North Wales, 139 miles. This bungalow meant everything to Grandpa and the whole family have great memories from the holidays we had there. As stated, the distance we will be walking locally is 139 miles (224km) sharing this distance between us with an aim to complete 122km each by the end of February.</span></p><p class=""p2"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><span class=""s1""></span></p><p class=""p2"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><span>We are going to set our target to raise at £100 and all donations will be going to RNLI.
