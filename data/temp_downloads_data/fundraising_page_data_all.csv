So you will know how hard this challenge is going to be for me. BHF is struggling more this year than ever before, because of the dreaded covid 19 pandemic, many of their charity shops have had to close, many of their main fundraising events have also had to be cancelled due to lockdown. Quite a lot of my family and friends have been unfortunate to have had problems with their hearts and I'm sure without the important research funded by this charity some of them would definitely not be here now, myself included, as without an operation on my heart when I was a child I would probably not be here now. I would be so grateful if once again you could find it in your &#34;hearts&#34; to donate some money to this worthwhile cause. However small you think the donation is, it will all be very much appreciated and used to continue funding important research and work. Thanks you so much in anticipation.

Virtual fundraising challenges like Dechox are a way to help us keep up the pace of progress. Your willpower will be funnelled into ground-breaking science and support for the people who need us most.

Because despite everything else happening at the moment, heart and circulatory diseases are still the world's biggest killers.

Guide Dogs is here to help solve this problem. We provide individual support that overcomes the emotional and physical challenges faced by people living with sight loss.

We work for a world where people with sight loss are never left out of life. We work for a world where blind people no longer feel invisible, where the quality of their eye sight is genuinely the only difference between them and the rest of society.

A world with enough support to make the challenges of sight loss no barrier to fulfilling your needs and dreams. A world where being blind or partially sighted isn't what defines you.","London Landmarks Half Marathon 2020","0","490","0","123","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1c5f7f6b-5ef5-4fca-9a42-a146ba95ff00",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The average lifeboat station in the North West costs £136,000 a year to run and we are going to have a significant shortfall in income due to the Coronavirus. We are asking all our friends and communities to donate what they can to keep us running.
All along the North West coast from Silloth to West Kirby, we will always be there to keep you and your loved ones safe, on our watch, there will be no preventable deaths on the North West coast. Please help us fulfil that mission.
