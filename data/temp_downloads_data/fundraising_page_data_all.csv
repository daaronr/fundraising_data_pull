I'm raising money for the British Heart Foundation and I'd be so grateful for your support. The BHF has helped halve the number of people dying from heart and circulatory disease in the UK but sadly every day hundreds of people lose their lives. It's only thanks to support from people like us that the BHF can create new treatments and discover new cures. £24 could pay for two hours of research by an early career scientist, but every pound helps so please give what you can to help me hit my target. </p><p>I would also like to share my story. Both of my parents died due to heart complications before my seventeenth birthday. Luckily one of them was brought back. </p><p>At my Dads funeral we raised money for this charity and as it is coming up to the anniversary of his passing I decided to raise money for them again in order to try and ensure no one else needs to go through this as not everyone is so lucky to get a parent back.</p><p>So please help and give what you can and aid the lifesaving research of the BHP.

The BHF have unfortunately been forced to make the devastating decision to half their 2020 research budget. It is thanks to the research done by the BHF, funded by donations, that now 7 out 10 people survive heart attacks instead of 7 out of 10 heart attacks being fatal like it was 60 years ago. It is their research which gave us the break throughs to diagnosing and treating numerous heart and circulatory diseases. Charities have never needed us more.</p><p>Virtual fundraising challenges such as Dechox is a great way to help out as well as give yourself a sense of achievement by completing these challenges. The willpower of the person taking on the challenge mixed with the donations they gather is put into continuing the vital research done by the BHF so that they can make more breakthroughs. Despite everything, heart and circulatory diseases are still the world's biggest killers. </p><p>Please donate or even join me in Dechox in March, 2021.

I'm walking for the millions of women and children who walk distances every day to get the water they need for themselves and their families to survive. I'm walking to raise funds so we can make clean water normal for everyone, everywhere. Clean water is a human right that everyone, everywhere should enjoy. But around the world 1 in 10 people have no choice but to drink dirty water, often from remote sources, risking their health, their safety and their chances in life. With clean water, people have an equal chance to be healthy, educated and financially secure.
