Springis the season of new beginnings for all. It is slowly getting warmer; the grass is getting a bit greener and the air feels a bit fresher. It is the perfect time of year to have a clean out and to get out! So this Spring why not Spring into Action for St John Ambulance and support our volunteers as they continue to step forward to give vital support to those in need across the country. 
 
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak our volunteers have given an incredible number of hours of support to patients in hospitals across the country, and we are not stopping. Throughout Spring we are continuing to mobilise thousands of volunteers to support the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination. 
 
We need funds to maintain our activities supporting the NHS in our COVID-19 response. The emergency is on-going, and our volunteers will continue to step forward to give vital support.

I love all things chocolate, sweets and cakes. We tend to make baked goods in our house every week without fail!!!! So this is going to be a real toughy for me (especially a serial snacker hubby who kindly sits next to me scoffing) but i am going to cut all of this out for the whole of March and hopefully raise some money in the process (i mean if i could lose a few lbs at the same time i wouldn't complain). I have people close to me that have had family and friends with heart problems and seen first hand how hard it is to deal with.

The reason  I picked this charity because my dad helped me understand how important this charity is to people who have their sight. This charity helps those who are blind or partially blind to have a life and help those gain confidence in themselves</p><p>My aim is to raise 500 pounds but whatever the amount we make at the end  Will be going to a good cause. Remember you do not have to donate please do share this with your friends and family to help spread the love for people who have lost their sight.</p><p><br/></p><p>Thank you so much for reading this Let the big 100 begin!</p>",NA,NA,"Adam's Big 100 Cycle","0","0","0","0","0","https://images.justgiving.com/image/b8de91d8-a876-4835-a0bb-6bc7e48be501.jpg","https://images.justgiving.com/image/b8de91d8-a876-4835-a0bb-6bc7e48be501.jpg?template=size150x150face","847486","Stephen Seager","/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/13850092","remember/847486",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We will be talking a small team of family and friends from Brownsover (Rugby) to Draycote water (Dunchurch) which is around a 15 mile walk. The charity is very close to our hearts and we have supported them for many years due to the life changing support they have given our family. The walk will take place on the Sunday 2nd of May.  </p><p><span>The sponsorship money you raise will truly make a difference. £140 could buy a Starter Kit for a new guide dog owner, containing everything they need to start a life with their new guide dog, this includes the iconic white harness.

Personally, I lost my fabulous father-in-law 2 years ago and the more we can learn about this horrific disease the better. Every charity needs extra support now, thanks to the lack of fundraising being able to take place during the pandemic, so this is our small way to aid them and support the amazing work these charities do.

Since the beginning of the year I have been walking a lot more and really enjoying it; it has certainly improved both my physical and mental health. So when I saw Marie Curie’s Step into Spring Challenge, (walking 10,000 steps a day to raise money) I thought it the ideal fund raising challenge for me. Although I love walking I am a fair weather walker so this challenge will make me go out walking every day, regardless of the weather; and hopefully at the same time I will be raising much needed funds for a very worthy cause. Marie Curie is a charity close to my heart, not only because our daughter is a doctor at a Marie Curie Hospice, and we know from her all the good work that they do, but also because as a family we have needed their services. Some years ago my father-in-law was looked after at home by Marie Curie nurses and last year when my mother became very ill and required palliative end of life care, in particular pain control, she had to be admitted to the local hospital rather than being cared for at home which had been her wish, because the services weren’t available in her area of the country. Marie Curie Nurses and hospices have been working tirelessly throughout the pandemic, providing vital care and support, and a listening ear to people in need. They can’t keep doing this without support though and like all charities Marie Curie have found things really difficult during the past year. Just £20 would pay for one hour of Marie Curie nursing in a patient’s home, £300 would pay for one in-patient admission for acute symptom control in a Marie Curie Hospice.

Throughout it all Marie Curie have continued to provide vital end of life care and support to people in your local community. As COVID-19 has robbed us all of many things and Marie Curie the opportunity to raise vital funds during their annual March fundraising event, The Great Daffodil Appeal, I have decided to do what I can to help. Stepping into Spring, I pledge to take not 10 but 15,000 steps each day in March to raise as much money for this great cause as possible.

Its a warm and welcoming place where we give expert care to people with a terminal illness, and their loved ones, every day of the year. 

Our hospice team includes doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, social workers and many more, and is supported by over 200 volunteers  who play a vital role in the running of the hospice.

We have a 24-bed in-patient unit, where relatives and friends can visit any time of the day or night, and stay with their loved ones if they wish.

Our out-patient unit offers clinics, therapies and group sessions  and freshly cooked lunches made by our chefs. We also support carers and families, including children, with practical advice, counselling and bereavement support groups.

We need to raise £9,600 per day to run the hospice, so every penny counts. Thank you for helping to make sure more people with a terminal illness in Solihull get the care and support they need.

But the Marie Curie nurses saw my family through the darkest hours with compassion, empathy and care. Without them, we would have found it much more difficult to bear. Please give what you can to raise money for the most giving and understanding of souls. My sister Marie was treated with such love and dignity and I will never forget that.

RNLI lifesavers are our lifeline. They’re the lifeboat crews who provide 24-hour search and rescue right around the UK and Ireland. The lifeguards keeping watch on 240 of the busiest beaches in the UK and Channel Islands. And the RNLI safety teams and educators working tirelessly to stop people getting into trouble in the first place.

More than five years of fighting has pushed Yemen and its health system to the brink of collapse. Millions of children lack access to clean water and sanitation facilities and are in desperate need of basic healthcare. Malnutrition is also at an all-time high, with 2 million children being malnourished. Just £11 could provide life-saving food for a child for a week.

The impact of a large-scale outbreak of coronavirus on children, especially poor and vulnerable children, has been immense. Children are at risk from the disease, but also from the disruption to health and education services, impacts on caregivers, and separation from family members.

From 15th February, well be walking, running, cycling, rowing and swimming to travel the 5,777 miles between Manchester to Madagascar, all in aid of highlighting WaterAid's work in Antenanarivo, Madagascar.

5,777 miles might take us a while to complete, so we are going to compete in two teams and start at each end - one team in Manchester and one team in Madagascar - and the objective is to meet in the middle by Easter, and see who gets there first!

Well be walking, running, cycling, rowing or even swimming (when allowed!) to help contribute individually and virtually to the 5,777 miles we need to complete together. 

The objective is to improve all our wellbeing, get us all out more in the fresh air and away from our computers, and to raise £5,777 for a truly magnificent cause!
