Earlier this year, in a moment of inspiration/madness I came up with the concept of 'twisting' this to complete 10,000Km (almost 6,214 miles) over the course of 12 months...that's like travelling from London, UK, to Cape Town, South Africa (plus a bit more besides).  The 'Twisted 10K' was born.</p><p>The outline plan is to cover the distance by completing a series of challenges across the UK. Some of these will be official events such as ultramarathons whilst others will be things that I organise independently. I'll also factor in the distance that I cover whilst training for these events.  This is a huge undertaking which will require me to cover an average of 27 KM (17 miles) every day for a year. <br/></p><p>Whilst racking up the kilometres, I'm hoping to complete four ultramarathons as part of the Threshold Trail Series, hike the Yorkshire 3 Peaks, and cycle the UK Coast to Coast and Hadrian's Cycleway as a circular route. The biggest challenge of all will see me ride from Land's End to John O'Groats and climbing the UK 3 Peaks (Snowdon, Scafell Pike and Ben Nevis) along the way.</p><p>I aim to raise £10,000 during the challenge - £1 for each KM completed.  I'll be fundraising for four charities, amongst them is Macmillan cancer support.<br/></p><p>You can find out more about the Twisted 10K and follow my journey at https://www.facebook.com/Twisted-10K-107209524524934</p><p>Thank you for reading and for considering making a donation to my efforts.</p>","9960e4b7-bda4-4c3a-884a-43994c2c0de4","Twisted10K","Twisted 10K - Macmillan Cancer Support","0","0","0","0","0","https://images.justgiving.com/image/2825c242-eb17-4132-ba5c-8b0d5e9d8a9e.jpg","https://images.justgiving.com/image/2825c242-eb17-4132-ba5c-8b0d5e9d8a9e.jpg?template=size150x150face","Completing 10,000KM (6214 miles) on foot and cycle because cancer destroys lives of sufferers and families","Completing 10,000KM (6214 miles) on foot and cycle","cancer destroys lives of sufferers and families","true",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

During that time she met and married Harry.</p><p>They went on to raise five children and she then returned to nursing in the Kirkstall district until her retirement.</p><p>Even in retirement she continued to care for others including the local sitting service where she gave her time and commitment to bring respite and comfort, <span>to people managing their partners with long term medical conditions at home. She was also a valued member of groups like The Thursday Club, knit and natter, cuppacare and the local choir.</span></p><p><span>She was a loving grandma to seven grandchildren, she loved making memories with them with trips to the countryside and the seaside, and regular family gatherings.</span></p><p><span>She travelled abroad with Harry as far as Australia a few years ago to meet with her brother and his family. They travelled extensively throughout the UK in their motorhome and on coach trips, and still found time to garden and meet up with family and friends.</span></p><p><span>Margaret didn’t want a funeral; she wanted her family and friends to have ‘a do’ in order to celebrate her life. The immediate family gathered on August Bank Holiday for an afternoon tea filled with lovely memories.

I have decided to partake in this 24 hour gaming marathon in aid of Macmillan. Cancer is something that has affected a lot of people very near and dear to me throughout my life and in memory of them I’m hoping to raise as much money as I can to help this charity. As you probably guessed I will be playing mostly warzone but I will also be doing challenges and playing other games for donations. Infact I will literally do anything gaming related for the right donations, so if you’re in need of a warzone win I’m all yours for the right price lol. 
Please, please help me in helping this charity as much as I possibly can.
Thanks, il see you in verdansk.

In September William underwent open heart surgery on bypass at the incredible Great Ormond Street Hospital to repair his valve and relieve aortic stenosis. We are enormously grateful to God that the surgery was a success. He will be regularly monitored for the rest of his life and will likely require further intervention one day but for now we are just so pleased that it looks like he could have something close to a normal childhood. William is now 1 and slowly recovering from his operation. He is the most amazing little boy and full of joy and cheekiness.</p><p><span>The lovely Greg suggested raising some money for The BHF through doing a duathalon which is so kind. I’m really keen to support him because the BHF fund all sorts of fantastic causes and make such a huge difference in finding cures and treatments for heart conditions. As well as this, specifically related to William, they’re ‘funding research to develop the next generation of heart valves that are long-lasting and avoid the need for anticoagulants.’ It’s exciting that this research could hugely improve William’s life in the future if (more likely when) he has a valve replacement.</span></p><p><span>Please give what you can to this fantastic cause.</span></p><p><span>Chris.</span></p>",NA,NA,"Greg doing an off road duathalon for The British Heart Foundation","62.50","0","250","125","0",NA,NA,"10km run, 40km cycle, 5km run","10km run, 40km cycle, 5km run",NA,"true",NA,NA,"https://images.justgiving.com/image/ef062c77-c153-4401-9a4d-3af315ab0f94.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true",NA,"https://images.justgiving.com/image/ef062c77-c153-4401-9a4d-3af315ab0f94.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true","https://images.justgiving.com/image/3c6223b4-011a-461d-bb4e-063b147c80b3.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true","https://images.justgiving.com/image/3c6223b4-011a-461d-bb4e-063b147c80b3.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true","https://images.justgiving.com/image/f8b3a851-4d54-4105-8b61-8bbd78c3e96a.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true","https://images.justgiving.com/image/f8b3a851-4d54-4105-8b61-8bbd78c3e96a.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true","https://images.justgiving.com/image/b3fb4fff-a3cf-4ec2-8cd7-c1792e0eddba.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true","https://images.justgiving.com/image/b3fb4fff-a3cf-4ec2-8cd7-c1792e0eddba.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true",NA,NA,NA

During these difficult COVID times, it's so important to us to be giving something back to our wider community and society in general, and as such our employees have committed to this challenge with great determination in the hope that we can really make a difference. Unfortunately, there are very few of us who have not been touched by heart or circulatory disease, stroke, dementia, diabetes within our own families/friend's circle. We hope you will be able to support us to raise some much needed funds for the BHF - this would mean so much to all of us. Every little counts and we greatly appreciate it! Our teams comprise 5 climbers per team, and every team has committed to achieve the Everest virtual climb within a 4 week period.
