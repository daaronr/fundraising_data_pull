Hello and thank you for reading, myself and some good friends and my amazing cousin are going to walk 26 miles along the Jurrasic coast to raise money for Macmillan. I lost my beautiful wife Jodie to cancer in July 2018, but Macmillan did so much for us both, with care and support and financial help. They made the last year so much more bearable, giving us opportunities to spend quality time together and to give me some lasting memories. I can never thank them enough for what they have done for us. Raising money for them gives me a reason to keep going, and I'll continue to do it for as long as I can. They care for the people left behind too and have offered me counselling on several occasions. I'm lucky to have some good friends and family to support me, and it is a struggle at times. I just want to make my Jodie proud and give back to such a worthy cause. Thanks for supporting my fundraising.  Macmillan Cancer Support is here to help everyone with cancer live life as fully as they can, providing physical, financial and emotional support. So whatever cancer throws your way, we’re right there with you.Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and secure.

About Our London Charity Partner Guide Dogs

Losing your sight shouldn't also mean losing your independence, confidence and freedom, but unfortunately, our world is a tough place when you cant see. In the UK, there are 360,000 people who are blind or partially sighted and half of them do not leave their homes alone.

Guide Dogs provide life-changing services:
- Guide Dogs
- Volunteer sighted guides (My Guides)
- Support for children and young people
- Orientation and mobility specialists
- Technology
- Support for friends and family","Citi's 2020/21 London Charity Partner","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,"true","true","true",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ef6b2eaa-f902-40aa-aa45-b11a0312334e",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As well as being a place where people can stay to get the expert care they need in a friendly and homely setting, we also support people visiting with clinics and therapies. These include yoga, exercise classes and relaxation. People using the day unit can also get together over a freshly cooked lunch from our chefs.

Relatives and friends can visit any time of the day or night, and stay with their loved ones if they wish to.
