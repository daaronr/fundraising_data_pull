As many of you will know we initially signed up for the Peak District Challenge scheduled for July 2020 which due to Covid had to be cancelled. We then changed to the Jurassic Coast Challenge for September 2020 but sadly this too was cancelled. And so we're trying again in the hope that our event in May - virus permitting - will get the go ahead. Fingers crossed!<br/></p><p>We're truly grateful to all those (22 supporters in total who are listed in our original GOSH JustGiving page: https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising-edit/teampurbrun) who donated in 2020 even though we didn't set off and would like to assure you that the incredible sum of £770 raised as part of our £1,000 target has been put to good use. It has ensured that Great Ormond Street Hospital during these most challenging of times has been able to continue its great work and, more importantly for our family, has continued to treat, support and care for our two &#34;junior&#34; members, now aged 9 and 7. They thankfully continue to grow, flourish and enjoy life. <br/></p><p>Anyway to help get us started on a training regime we are taking part in a virtual challenge, namely, walking the Welsh Coastal Path, Chepstow to Chester, 870 miles!!! We have a year to complete this particular challenge and are accompanied by Zo<span>ë</span>, Pete's daughter, and Evelyn, our 1 year old granddaughter, who are making sure we keep to a strict regime. We are using it as a means to clock up the mileage and stamina we'll need to do the 26.2 miles we'll be doing from Weymouth to Bridport on Sunday 16 May 2021. <br/></p><p>We'll let you know how we progress, you can follow us here: https://www.endtoend.run/map-wcp3/ by typing 'Pete Browne' into the 'search for names' box, we're Bib number 39228 .....

The Sussexman triathlon or Lockdown Ironman was born.<br/><br/>The idea is simple, and Ironman distance triathlon (3.8k swim, 112 mile cycle, 26 mile run) starting in the sea at Brighton, riding over the South Downs, and then a marathon from Hampton court in central London and finishing at Big Ben.<br/><br/>Of course, it’s all got to be socially distanced,  so I’ll be doing it solo, but supported through the different stages by friends from Mid Sussex Triathlon Club, some swimming, others cycling and some running.  The race is scheduled for Saturday 19th June.<br/><br/>The plan is to raise a little money along the way.  I will be fundraising for the RLNI - lifeboats.  We all expect them to ‘just be there’ when we get into trouble like all the other emergency services, but they are charity made up of volunteers and facing all the same COVID challenges.  The more crazy people like me who take to sea swimming the more they are going to be in demand, so I would like to give something back.
