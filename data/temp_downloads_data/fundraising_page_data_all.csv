Mum always loved a laugh about anything and everything, I can't recall at any time that she sat and cried about the situation, the only thing she said was....&#34;oh well, I've had a good life, made lots of friends and memories along the way, what more could I ask for?&#34;.

This Heart Month, our team are committing to walk/jog/run 100km (60 miles) and we'd love to get as many people across the community to join in on the challenge too. 100km might sound a lot, but over a month it works out at roughly 2 miles a day - that's roughly a 20min jog, or a 30 minute walk.

We're asking everyone who takes part to set a target of £100 and help spread the word. If we get 60 people to join the team, then that's £6,000 raised for the BHF's 60th year to go towards life-saving research. If 2020 taught us anything, it's that research works!

The page will be live until the end of March (and, depending on uptake, into April) so if you want to take part in the challenge once the weather warms up, that's totally fine too!</p>","BHF100K - 60 miles for 60 year","0","0","0","0","0","true","true",NA,NA,"https://images.justgiving.com/image/75ffa425-6c87-4b08-90b4-b1b3d27e3541.jpg","https://images.justgiving.com/image/75ffa425-6c87-4b08-90b4-b1b3d27e3541.jpg?template=size150x150face",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1eb87a3a-7efc-4599-ba08-9e3537b6f263","BHF100K",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This came after family member suffered with a heart condition that effected the whole family.</p><p>4 years on, they're back and joined by Charlie and Dan for another tough challenge! <br/></p><p><u><b>This Years Challenge - The Six Month Travel<br/></b></u></p><p>A hard year calls for a hard challenge! Team 'Chafing The Dream' will be walking/running/cycling all across europe (Not Literally!)</p><p>Between all five of us, we will be travelling the distance that would be required to travel from one country to another stopping in 7 times with our finishing line being in Estonia. <br/></p><p><b><u>How Will It Work?</u></b></p><p>As an example, our first stop is intenting to be Rotterdam. This is 420 miles away from our starting point in the forest of dean. During month one, the team will achive 420 miles between them by either walking/running/cycling. Once that distance has been hit, we will move onto the next country! This will continue untill we hit our finishing line. Of course, if we hit Estonia early, we will contine to travel until our 6 months are up! We will keep everyone updated with regular posts on facebook and keeping track of progess on tracking apps.<br/></p><p>during the 6 months, we will be travelling <br/></p><p>England, Forest of Dean ---&gt; Netherlands, Rotterdam (420 miles)</p><p>Netherlands, Rotterdam ---&gt; Germany, Nuremberg (418 miles)</p><p>Germany, Nuremberg ---&gt; Czech Republic, Prague (180 miles)</p><p>Czech Republic, Prague ---&gt; Poland, Krakow (390 miles)</p><p>Poland, Krakow ---&gt; Lithuania, Kaunas (453 miles)</p><p>Lithuania, Kaunas ---&gt; Lativa, Riga (183 miles)</p><p>Lativa, Riga ---&gt; Estonia, Narva (291 miles)<br/></p><p>We understand that covid has hit many people hard financially, so we have a realistic but big target of £1,200. The BHF has helped halve the number of people dying from heart and circulatory disease in the UK but sadly every day hundreds of people lose their lives. It's only thanks to support from people like us that the BHF can create new treatments and discover new cures. £24 could pay for two hours of research by an early career scientist, but every pound helps so please give what you can to help me hit our target.

BHF was his chosen charity so that was always on the shortlist to raise money for. Recently however a very best friend of mine suffered a heart attack but is thankfully recovering well at home &#128074; A wake up call to us all about taking care of our hearts. So that was it, charity decided upon.</p><p>So as the title suggests, I am personally attempting to walk 4000 miles in 2021, or 8 million steps in total. Or to Dubai. It's ok, it only works out at an average of 11 miles, or 22,000 steps every single day. Easy peasy right &#128580;&#128514; This is the underlying challenge that runs throughout the year and to help reach that target there's various special activities planned &#128526;</p><p>In August, a group of us are aiming to walk 70kms (44 miles) to celebrate the 70th birthday. It is going to be over two days, camping overnight, and will be coastal, so it will includes lots of ups and downs and rugged terrain. Fingers crossed my friend in recovery will be fit enough by then to tackle some, if not all of it &#128521;</p><p>There are other things in the pipeline as well. A half marathon is booked up, a 70 miles in a day bike ride planned in and potentially a one, two or three peak challenge taking place .....&#129310; but I've blabbered on enough now so might add those details at a later date.</p><p><span>So thanks for your time.

That is why we have decided to create this page to receive donations from you to help support Cancer Research UK. This life-saving charity needs your support more than ever due to the pandemic. The effects of Covid-19 has meant that Cancer Research UK has had to cut its funding for research by £45 Million. We ask you humbly to please donate to Cancer Research.

Players and parents along with their coach will cover the 56 miles from Rustington Otters HQ to the home of football, Wembley Stadium. After having our season cut short for a second season in a row and missing out on a cup final last season due to the covid crisis, Rustington Otters U10s are determined to put the disapointment behind them,remain active and raise some money for a worthy cause with their efforts. Between them they will cover a combined total of 1288 miles as they walk, jog and run the 56 miles on The Road to Wembley. <br/></p><p>The team are also undertaking this fundraising effort in memory of Paul Bridle. Paul was a parent of one of our players and very sadly, recently lost his heroic 18 month battle to cancer. Paul was a huge lover of football, volunteering countless hours coaching and managing teams at Rustington Otters. Paul was also a big supporter of the U10s and was often on hand to offer his words of encouragement to all the players from the sidelines as they developed from the U6s to U10s. </p><p>So if possible  please donate anything you can to help inspire the team to reach their target for Cancer Research and aid in the fight against cancer.  <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

The average lifeboat station in the North West costs £136,000 a year to run and we are going to have a significant shortfall in income due to the Coronavirus. We are asking all our friends and communities to donate what they can to keep us running.
All along the North West coast from Silloth to West Kirby, we will always be there to keep you and your loved ones safe, on our watch, there will be no preventable deaths on the North West coast. Please help us fulfil that mission.
