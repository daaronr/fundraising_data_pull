Family legend has it that the famous heroine Grace Darling is a distant relative. He started back in the mid 1970's as a Lifeboat Man on the Sheerness Lifeboat. He continued to support as a member following his transfer from the island to Cliffe where he served as the village bobby.</p><p>Upon his move to Norfolk in the late 1990's he was once again able to take on a more active support role. Although no longer physically able to serve on a lifeboat, he spent time travelling around East Anglia performing Sea Checks on leisure vessles. this gave him immense satisfaction and as anyone knows, if you ever received a Christmas card from him and Josie you can guarantee that it will have been one in support of the RNLI. </p><p>Tim's funeral is on Wednesday 23rd December 2020 and the family have requested that there are no flowers but donations be made to the RNLI Sheerness Division via this page. </p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.
