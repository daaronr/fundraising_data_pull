First of all I’d like to thank you for clicking on the link and supporting me. As bad as last year (2020) was for us all, it got even worse for me and my family in September when we were told the news that no family wants to hear, my Nan was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer. </p><p>After many appointments and check ups the doctors discovered that the tumour was very aggressive so they decided to proceed with a mastectomy. <span>Due it being aggressive, they decided that my Nan should undergo intensive chemotherapy. My Nan’s white blood cell count is now very low which means her immune system is struggling to fight off infections. </span></p><p><span>As most of us know, the side affects of chemotherapy can be quite intense and unfortunately after my Nan’s first round she started to lose her hair. Most people that know me know that I am a massive family man and it is frustrating and upsetting for me to watch my Nan go through all of this, knowing that I can’t do anything to help. So I feel as though the least I can do is show her that she isn’t going through this alone as I am by her side going through it with her.</span></p><p><span> I’m going to shave all my hair off and go bald on Saturday 6th February. The charity I have chosen to raise money for is Macmillan Cancer Support, I know times are hard for people but any donation no matter how small it is will be very much appreciated! </span><br/></p><p>Thank you all for reading my story</p><p>Peace and love</p><p>Charlie xxx</p>","Going bald for breast cancer!","161.25","0","1120","112","0","I am going bald because I want my Nan to know she is not alone!","I am going bald","I want my Nan to know she is not alone!",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Every moment I spent with Ewart he inspired me to become the very best person I can be, to help others despite personal strife, and not to let life pass me by. <br/><br/>Ewart dedicated his life to raising money for a long list of charities and was even invited to afternoon tea with the Queen in recognition of his efforts. <br/><br/>Early last year, Ewart suffered internal bleeding, heart failure, a stroke, and coronavirus. He kept on fighting for 10 months but unfortunately passed away in October. As a family we all cared for him at home, where he wanted to be, in his final five months and some of those moments we spent with him will be cherished forever. He was deeply loved by his family, friends, and community and will be dearly missed. <br/><br/>If you'd like to hear more about Ewart's incredible life I have included a video link for his funeral and eulogy below:<br/><br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xfc_wIVMuk&amp;feature=youtu.be <br/><br/>I chose the British Heart Foundation as they fund important research into circulatory diseases, especially heart disease and stroke, which affect thousands of families every year.<br/><br/>This time last year I couldn't even contemplate running 5k a week, so ramping it up to above 30k per week is going to be tough! I'm planning on taking part in at least three fundraising events this year, this one's for Ewart.<br/><br/>Please see below for some more information about British Heart Foundation:<br/><br/>We fund over £100 million of research each year into all heart and circulatory diseases and the things that cause them. Heart diseases. Stroke. Vascular Dementia. Diabetes. They’re all connected, and they’re all under our microscope.<br/>Research has given us machines that can restart hearts, the ability to fix arteries in tiny babies, devices to correct heartbeats, the power to give someone a heart they weren’t born with, and so much more.<br/>We’ve helped transform survival rates but heart and circulatory diseases still kill 1 in 4 people in the UK, they cause heartbreak on every street. And our work is urgent and vital as ever.<br/>Our research, is the promise to protect the people we love. Our parents. Our brothers. Our sisters. Our grandparents. Our closest friends.<br/>Research is who we are. The promise of future cures and treatments. The promise to beat heartbreak forever.<br/>People’s donations have got us this far. Every breakthrough we’ve made, funded by people like you.

I decided to do this challenge again this year because of all the amazing support I got last year for this! I raised an outstanding £155 to help others in desperate need! I have close family and friends who suffer heart conditions therefor this is an important charity for me. I'm raising money for the British Heart Foundation's research and I'd be so grateful for your support. The BHF has helped halve the number of people dying from heart and circulatory disease in the UK but sadly every day hundreds of people lose their lives. It's only thanks to support from people like us that the BHF can create new treatments and discover new cures. £24 could pay for two hours of research by an early career scientist, but every pound helps so please give what you can to help me hit my target. </span><br/></p><p>The pandemic is the biggest challenge we've faced in our 60 year history. And it's led to us being forced to make the devastating decision to cut our 2020 research budget in half.Because despite everything else happening at the moment, heart and circulatory diseases are still the world's biggest killers.

So, yeah.</p><p>I have a lot of okay memories of the time around Christmas 2010 - trying my first gingerbread latte, hanging out constantly at the <span class=""aCOpRe""><span>Christkindelmarkt</span></span><!--EndFragment--> in Leeds, wondering what I was going to do for my 21st birthday that was fast approaching, seeing my family and friends come together in the best of ways and having to buy 5 kids Christmas presents for the first time. But they're all slightly tinged with sadness, and I have a lot of not okay memories of that time too.</p><p>I was drinking coffee at the Christmas market so much because its location in Millennium Square was a short walk away from the LGI, where my Dad was being treated for ventricular heart failure. He'd already been in Calderdale Royal for a while before that, and our lives had become a routine of go about your day as best you could, then trek up to the hospital for visiting times, grab something quick to eat and then head home to await the phone calls from people wanting to know what was happening. (If you challenged me to, I could probably still find my way to Ward 6C in Halifax with my eyes closed and one hand tied behind my back.)<!--EndFragment--><br/></p><p>At the time, the hospital had some leaflets on things we could expect to happen, changes to look out for, and things to ask the doctors about. These were available for free, sitting in a holder on one of the ward's walls thanks to the British Heart Foundation. And those leaflets helped us deal more than we could say. So if I can, I want to help give a bit back.</p><p>There are some stories from that time and the months that followed that are on the lighter side too. The ice in the flasks, cheese you could read a newspaper through, a nurse pulling my Mum to the side to warn her about my Dad's appearance (he'd gotten bored and shaved his own head), sitting as a family eating fruit ice lollies in a ward lounge, my Dad forgetting the word &#34;Freemasons&#34;, the letter in which it was stated that my Dad was &#34;turning the coroner&#34;, and the magazine story, which is one best not told in polite company.</p><p>The Covid pandemic has affected a lot of things in our lives, and one of those is the ability for charities to raise money to fund what they do. If I can raise even a bit of money by giving up chocolate for a month, maybe it will help a family who are in the situation we were in, and to me, that makes it all worth it. If you can donate, I'm eternally grateful, and if you can't, the fact that you've made it this far means a lot to me. Thank you.<br/><br/>(As an aside - if I don't hit my target, I'm going to pay any money that's short myself. Because it's a cause that's close to my heart. Pun very much intended.)<br/></p>","My Dechox Fundraising Page","7.50","0","40","133","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"f0b38c95-8e29-421c-81e0-4a7b00151c83",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is my birthday in March so believe me this is no easy feat for me but i’m going to do it, with your support and encouragement.  All of March i will be giving up chocolate, cakes and all sweet treats, in return i would like to ask that my friends and family make a donation, however small to the British Heart Foundation via my just giving page and help spur me on to complete the challenge. So those of you who would maybe buy me chocolates for my birthday, make a donation instead please.  Even if i only get a third of the way towards my target i will be very grateful as i know these are incredibly hard times for everyone. Every little helps and giving up my sweet treats for a month is a small price to pay.

This is the fundraiser page for my 21 ultramarathons in 21 days challenge I’ll be doing from my everyday wheelchair this February for the Guide Dogs For The Blind Association. I’ll be doing a 52.4 mile ultra or the equivalent of 2 marathons back to back every day for 21 days from the 1st February 2021.</p><p>A bit about me. My name is Peter Smorthit and I’m a 29 year old T10 complete paraplegic. I was involved in a scaffold collapse accident on a building site I was working on ten years ago age 19 which left me paralysed from just above the waist down and completely reliant on a wheelchair. I also sustained a secondary injury at T4/5 which affects my diaphragm and balance. I’ve survived sepsis and had 2 full on strokes since as well but refuse to let any of that define me and continue to live life to the fullest I can helping out great causes along the way too with my marathons, triathlons and mad challenges I do from my wheelchair like this one. So far to date I’ve completed 132 Marathons, 103 Half Marathons and 79 Ultramarathons from my everyday wheelchair. I’ve  got 21 more Ultramarathons to go to reach my 100th ultra milestone and came up with the idea of doing 52.4 miles or the equivalent of 2 marathons a day back to back for 21 days from my everyday wheelchair. Wanted to do something for another brilliant cause and thought what better than to do this challenge for The Guide Dogs for The Blind Association.</p><p>Hoping through doing this challenge I can raise awareness of the important role guide dogs play in keeping so many visually impaired people living independently, enabling them to do the everyday tasks so many of us take for granted and to be able to raise funds to help them continue their brilliant work providing a lifeline to so many visually impaired people through the use of assistance dogs. Any donations no matter how small or shares/ spreading the word are all greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading. </p>","Peters  21 ultramarathons in 21 days challenge from an everyday wheelchair","0","0","0","0","0","21 ultras in 21 days from my everyday wheelchair because The work they do for visually impaired people","21 ultras in 21 days from my everyday wheelchair","The work they do for visually impaired people",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There are many people here today who simply would not be alive if it wasn’t for Cancer Research, their trials have literally saved lives.  There’s a long way to go but the funding is essential. <br/><br/>Tony’s diagnosis devastatingly came too late and he was not able to have treatment to save him but there’s been so many advances in treatment and I hope to contribute to future trials.<br/><br/>Tony has missed out on far too much dying at the young age of 43 with lung cancer. He never got the chance to meet Thomas's beautiful and wonderful wife Gemma,  and our darling Grandson, Samuel. If any of you are able to donate in recognition of my 60th and should have been Tony’s, it would mean the World to myself, Tom and Nat. I fully appreciate that not everyone will be able to donate during such uncertain times but any donations made in Tony’s memory would be fantastic. Let’s stop other families from going through this utter devastation.

It also meant I could sit on his bed and eat a Chinese takeaway with him (this was his favourite),  I would stand on his bed and brush his hair and put my clips in it to make him laugh.</span></p><p>People need these wonderful nurses and carers, Marie Curie rely on fundraising to help them continue to help others, these are difficult times but please help me raise much needed funds for Marie Curie so other families can benefit from their support as we did. &#128591;&#128588;<br/><br/><br/>I aim to run &#127939;&#8205;<U+2640><U+FE0F>60 km through the month of February for this cause, I am definitely up for the challenge!<br/><br/><br/>If you feel able, please support me, every little helps.<br/><br/>Feel free to share my page with your friends and family to help Marie Curie.&#127803;<br/><br/><br/>Thanks for reading and I will keep you updated!!<br/></p>","Embos 60km February Dash for Marie Curie","10","0","40","27","0","Emilys 60km because they supported us to care for grandad at home.","Emilys 60km","they supported us to care for grandad at home.","https://images.justgiving.com/image/2c0e8110-80b9-4676-b57d-acc591935d65.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true","https://images.justgiving.com/image/2c0e8110-80b9-4676-b57d-acc591935d65.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true","580e346b-5397-4ee4-940b-240710f2f094",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"835388","Josef Kriz","/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/13717616","remember/835388",NA,"https://images.justgiving.com/image/ccbed26d-8e84-49b9-a608-e57ab4b69ad9.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true","https://images.justgiving.com/image/ccbed26d-8e84-49b9-a608-e57ab4b69ad9.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There was really only 2 rules for the challenge 1. Mileage could only be achieved when a player is accompanied by a parent 2. Have fun and enjoy the quality time together. </p><p>The team destroyed the challenge in a single weekend and all the parents had enjoyed spending quality time with there children and enjoying the outdoors. </p><p>We then set ourselves a new challenge of virtually visiting all of the teams stadiums which the team supported: starting from K-Sports travelling to Charlton, to Tottenham, to Arsenal, to Chelsea, to Manchester United , To Motherwell, to PSG, and finally to Bayern Munich equating to 1,525 miles.</p><p>Unfortunately one of our players dads (Robin) caught the coronavirus and sadly passed away. Robin was a man who was into his Rugby so rather than making Bayern Munich our final stop we would do a few more miles and we would visit he's local club Aylesford Bulls Rugby Club and finish our journey at Twickenham. An additional 726 miles totalling <u><b>2,251 miles.</b></u></p><p>This is an extremely difficult challenge for boys aged between 9 /10, and even more so for the parents. But Robin was a truly lovely man who would do anything for anyone and we would love to complete this challenge in memory of Robin, you will be truly missed by your K-Sports family. </p><p>UNICEF was close to Robins heart and we would like to thank everyone for your kind support for such a great cause, your donations are greatly appreciated.</p><p>Thank you</p>","K-Sports Colts U10's Virtual Stadium Tour","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"835440","Robin Barnes","/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/13717348","remember/835440",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
