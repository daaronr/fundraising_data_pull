So it's the most efficient way to donate - saving time and cutting costs.</p><p>Firstly thank you for visiting my just giving page, I am doing this winter walk for 2 reasons firstly as a warm up walk for my bigger challenge in September 2021 when I will be taking on the Thames Path Challenge and walking 62 miles continuously for Cancer Research UK. The second reason is to raise money for a charity who has recently helped my husband who has been diagnosed with bowel cancer. The effects after being told you have cancer are devastating and Macmillan have been there with the support and answered questions my husband had and I have no doubt they will continue to be there for us as a family should we need them.  So any amount you are able to donate for this very worthy charity would be much appreciated by not only myself but I’m sure every other cancer patient and their family members who use the support this charity provides.</p>",NA,NA,"Natalie's Winter Walk 2021","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,"true","https://images.justgiving.com/image/06816e5f-3b35-46a2-acaa-9146afb24228.jpg","https://images.justgiving.com/image/06816e5f-3b35-46a2-acaa-9146afb24228.jpg?template=size150x150face",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

During December hundreds of our fundraising dogs across the UK would usually be out and about wagging their tails and meeting you at supermarket and street collections, Christmas fairs and festive coffee mornings. Our four-legged fundraisers support the 400+ fundraising groups across the UK from Glasgow to Plymouth and everywhere in between.

Due to the current situation, most of our fundraising groups will not be out collecting this festive season, and our four-legged fundraisers will be very much missed! We hope you will do your bit and help us as we aim to raise enough for 12 new guide dog partnerships! Heres how you can join in:

During December hundreds of our fundraising dogs across the UK would usually be out and about wagging their tails and meeting you at supermarket and street collections, Christmas fairs and festive coffee mornings. Our four-legged fundraisers support the 400+ fundraising groups across the UK from Glasgow to Plymouth and everywhere in between.

Due to the current situation, most of our fundraising groups will not be out collecting this festive season, and our four-legged fundraisers will be very much missed! We hope you will do your bit and help us as we aim to raise enough for 12 new guide dog partnerships! Heres how you can join in:

You could complete 100 metres, 100 minutes, 100 days  be creative!

The sponsorship money you raise will make a difference. £100 could pay for five hours' training at a Guide Dogs training school.

It's thanks to people like you that we can continue to provide life-changing services, like our guide dogs, to people with sight loss. So, a huge thank you and lots of luck for your challenge!

Not the fundraising, not even the cycling. But then Covid happened and changed everything.</p><p>I suddenly realised a few months ago that I couldn’t “just go” abroad anymore- and that made me a bit sad. At the same time, I (like a lot of us!) was eating a bit too much in lockdown #1 and getting less active. So, in late Summer, I decided to get on my exercise bike. </p><p>What started out as daily 5km rides to improve my fitness soon became daily 20-25 mile rides... but, despite the improved fitness, I felt like something was missing. I needed to “go” somewhere- to complete a tangible journey...yes, it’d have to be a virtual one, but I needed it to be real. I needed to complete a Pandemicathon! </p><p>Which is when I decided to virtually take on the epic 874 mile ride from John O’Groats to Lands End. I successfully completed that on 10 October 2020... and on 11 October started the next leg of my Pandemicathon.</p><p>I took a virtual ferry from Lands End, Cornwall to Brest, France. I then started Leg 2 and departed Brest for the Portuguese capital, Lisbon. <span>It’s</span><span> a massive 1,150+ mile bike ride - although my final mileage will depend on the exact route I take and any detours I might make along the way, as I virtually explore France, Spain and Portugal... I rather suspect detours might happen around Cognac, Bordeaux and Rioja... <span style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);float: none;"">&#127863;but </span>do please feel free to recommend other places for me to “visit” on my ride! </span></p><p>I hope the prospect of me cycling 2000+ miles across Europe might be worthy of some pennies for a great cause! <span>If my little legs make it, who knows where I’ll go afterwards... But I’ll keep peddling while the money is being raised.</span></p><p><span>Anyway, you can see my whole journey up to this point by following me on Strava - where I’ve posted pictures of the places I’ve been. And from today onwards, Strava will update this page too. </span></p><p><span>Cancer Research does such great work as they strive to beat cancer. I watched the Stand Up To Cancer Gogglebox and was so moved by the stories that I decided to do my bit to try to help beat this horrible disease. I know lots of people who have been affected by cancer - I’m sure you do too. Please help support their efforts to find a cure. </span></p><p><span>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

She gave the best hugs. <br/><br/>Her kindness and compassion were unparalleled; she did more for others than anyone else we know and never sought praise or reward. <br/><br/>Pierina loved hard and without a single condition; she expected absolutely nothing in return for it either. She was also not afraid of telling you just how much she loved you and she shared your pain and hurt as if it were her own. If she could have taken it on herself she would have and without a second thought. <br/><br/>She was the heart and soul of our family and everyone’s biggest fan and supporter.  Our lives (and those of the people she loved and cared for) were full of praise, admiration and so much love, and that love made you feel so special. She built you up and never ever knocked you down. Pierina was always there for anyone who asked - she would do anything for you. <br/><br/>Everyone deserves a Pierina in their lives. She was the life and soul of the party and a perpetual happy thread in all the lives she touched. <br/><br/>In remembrance of Pierina, a loving wife, mother, mother-in-law. grandmother, great-grandmother, sister, sister-in-law, aunt, great-aunt, godmother and friend, please help us raise money for this wonderful charity which is so close to our hearts.<br/></p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

As well as being a place where people can stay to get the expert care they need in a friendly and homely setting, we also support people visiting with clinics and therapies. These include yoga, exercise classes and relaxation. People using the day unit can also get together over a freshly cooked lunch from our chefs.

Relatives and friends can visit any time of the day or night, and stay with their loved ones if they wish to.

We have many supporters in our community and are very grateful of their ongoing support, especially during the current difficult times.<br/><br/>The Ballycotton Lifeboat station was established by the Institution in 1858 to afford protection to the shipping frequenting the port of Cork and together with the new stations at Youghal and Ardmore (closed 1895) and others contemplated to guard the English and Irish Channels. The crews at Ballycotton have been presented with 19 awards for gallantry – the most recent in 2002. For another rescue in 1936, Gold, Silver and Bronze medals were all awarded. <br/><br/>Keeping our Ballycotton lifeboat maintained, fuelled and ever ready to go to the rescue is expensive and we rely entirely on voluntary donations to ensure this service is maintained. Add to that crew training and kit, and the euros start to add up. During the pandemic we have still been offering a lifesaving service and are continuing to raise vital funds. However we haven’t been able to take part in our traditional fundraising this year and rely on donations from the public to continue saving lives. Your donation will help support the run the Ballycotton lifeboat.<br/><br/><br/>Our RNLI lifeboats in Ireland protect hundreds of communities through our 24-hour search and rescue service. They rely on the safest, most reliable lifeboats and modern stations to launch from. <br/>Irelands unrivalled coasts and inland waters are valued by local communities and visitors alike.
