She was strong and positive about her illness and she was the most genuine lovely mother, wife, sister, daughter, the brightest soul. As we say back in Mexico: “God gives his toughest battles to his strongest warriors”.  I’m doing this for my family and all of us that stayed here for her and all those people out there fighting this battle. She is and will be my motivation for the following days, and I wish this help others in their fight against cancer. Thank you all for reading me.

I packed my bags and went up to London to be his full time carer. Took him to all his chemo appointments, done his shopping. Showered him. He was also peg fed. So I would do his feeds and flushes. With a district nurse who would come out twice daily to administrate his medication. He was booked for 3 Chemo visits and during this time, he was 6stone in weight. They didn’t think the chemo would work as they was trying to build up his weight... but he had the first 2 treatments and when we went to see the consultant and have a check up ready for the last infusion. They put it on hold as they said the cancer was going. They looked shocked. Then his sister died of cancer on the 23rd of September and he died the same day of a heart attack. Was a horrible day. But before he left. He thanked me for me being there for him. So I’m doing this in memory of my grandfather Patrick Joseph Regan <U+0001F49A> And hope can help raise some money to Macmillan as I know they do a great job .</p>","Oregan11","0","0","0","0","0","true",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"53922849-6e69-4322-addb-a2b7a21e32e5",NA,NA,NA

At my school we are doing elf kicks to raise as much money as we can for BHF, we have to complete 10 minutes of exercise a day for 12 days. BHF means a lot to me because without them 9 years ago I wouldn’t be here today. I was born with a single ventricle heart condition meaning that I needed open heart surgery almost immediately after birth. The surgery I needed only became available 10 years before I was born, so I was very lucky. I’ve been through 3 open heart surgeries and I’m likely to need more in the future. Despite suffering a high level of pain most days, due to having arthritis, I am determined to complete all of the exercises so I can raise as much money as possible; this will help save the lives of other children like me.

Our plans included my long held ambition of seeing Mount Everest by trekking to base camp. We trained hard and I was as fit as I had been in years. We were due to set off on our adventure on 28 September. Unfortunately I suffered a heart attack in mid August 2016 and so our plans had to change. We did travel and visit Nepal but I am still to visit base camp. In September 2018 I had open heart bypass surgery and pleased to say I am feeling fit and well. Throughout the past four years I have been encouraged and supported by Professor John Somauroo at Broad Green Heart and Chest Hospital.</p><p>Unfortunately John died earlier this year and so I am doing this challenge in his memory.</p><p>The challenge is to &#34;Everest by bike in December&#34; In other words to climb at least 29030 ft (8848m) on my turbo trainer.

The BHF has helped halve the number of people dying from heart and circulatory disease in the UK but sadly every day hundreds of people lose their lives. It's only thanks to support from people like us that the BHF can create new treatments and discover new cures. £24 could pay for two hours of research by an early career scientist, but every pound helps so please give what you can to help me hit my target.

You can choose to Run100, Cycle100 or Swim100 between 1 July and 31 November. However you take on your 100, get sponsored to do it and help us supporting people living with sight loss. 

You could complete 100 metres, 100 minutes, 100 days  be creative!

The sponsorship money you raise will make a difference. £100 could pay for five hours' training at a Guide Dogs training school.

It's thanks to people like you that we can continue to provide life-changing services, like our guide dogs, to people with sight loss. So, a huge thank you and lots of luck for your challenge!

As GOSH plays a role in the national response to the COVID-19 crisis by treating more children from hospitals across London, resources will become increasingly stretched.   

The hospital needs the support of Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity (GOSH Charity) now more than ever, so it can continue to deliver the best, life-saving care for seriously ill children. 

Your support will help keep me going when things get tough and give me the power-up I need to complete this challenge. Its quick, easy and secure to donate, just press the give now button on the right.
