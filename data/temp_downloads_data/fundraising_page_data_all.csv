During December hundreds of our fundraising dogs across the UK would usually be out and about wagging their tails and meeting you at supermarket and street collections, Christmas fairs and festive coffee mornings. Our four-legged fundraisers support the 400+ fundraising groups across the UK from Glasgow to Plymouth and everywhere in between.

Due to the current situation, most of our fundraising groups will not be out collecting this festive season, and our four-legged fundraisers will be very much missed! We hope you will do your bit and help us as we aim to raise enough for 12 new guide dog partnerships! Heres how you can join in:

RNLI lifesavers are our lifeline. They’re the lifeboat crews who provide 24-hour search and rescue right around the UK and Ireland. The lifeguards keeping watch on 240 of the busiest beaches in the UK and Channel Islands. And the RNLI safety teams and educators working tirelessly to stop people getting into trouble in the first place.
