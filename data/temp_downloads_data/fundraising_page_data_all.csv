Some of us have not ridden a bike for years let alone anything of this distance, combined with our age and fitness this is going to be a big challenge.

So to give us that incentive and drive we will cycle and try to raise a few quid for the British Heart Foundation in memory of Tony who sadly passed away in 2019.

We are not setting a target as anything we can raise between us will be greatly appreciated in these difficult times for life saving charities.

Your small steps will help Guide Dogs make giant leaps. Just one week of stepping can make a difference to the life of children and adults living with sight loss. Raise over £50 (£25 for children) and well replace those worn out socks with a brand-new Guide Dogs pair designed by an international fashion icon!

How your funds will change lives...

-	£50 could pay for fun, tactile activities to help children co-ordinate their muscles and movements.

-	£96 could pay for an eye test each for two guide dogs in training

-	£116 could buy a Training School Kit for one of our guide dog trainers who will teach pups the specialist skills they need as fully qualified guide dogs.

-	£710 could buy a Birthing Kit containing all the essential equipment for a guide dog mum to safely deliver her puppies.

For any parent, it is a worrying time when your child needs hospital treatment. But if your child is seriously ill, in the middle of a pandemic, this is even more daunting. 

With infection control restrictions on parents staying with their children, worry around travelling safely to and from hospital and being treated by staff in protective clothing, what is already a stressful time is even more challenging.

Your support could help fund services like the hospitals incredible Play team, Social Work Service and multi-faith chaplaincy team, as well as funding family accommodation so mums and dads stay near their children.

Thank you to those who had already sponsored me for last years cancelled event -  that money rolls over into this event.<br/><br/>Every day brings new challenges at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH). Every day, 619 children and young people from across the UK arrive for life-changing treatments. Despite the greatest challenges a child can face, the hospital is a place where being sick does not always mean being sad. And it’s a place where you’ll find – today and every day – some of the bravest people you could ever meet. <br/><br/>This extraordinary hospital has always depended on charitable support, and every day is a chance for you to make a difference.<br/><br/>Over the weekend of 21-23rd May I will be taking on the crazy challenge started by David Goggins - Run 4 miles every 4 hours for 48 hours.<br/><br/>Whilst I won’t be asking you to join in the whole challenge, you can sign up for a ‘wave’ starting at 6pm on Friday 21 May when you can run/jog/walk 4 miles at your own pace. The next ‘waves’ will be 10pm, 2am, 6am, 10am, 2pm etc so choose a time to suit you. Hopefully we can share some live coverage!!<br/><br/>Adhering to COVID guidance at the time, small groups may be able to go out together physically and I am hoping some of you may be able to join me in Stanton to keep me going! <br/><br/>For a suggested minimum £10 donation you will get a GOSH medal. Half of the profits will go to Sarah Dunsdon’s Bowel Cancer Mega May challenge and half to GOSH.<br/><br/>For an extra £2 I am asking you to guess how long it will take for me to run 48 miles over 48 hours. For the mathematicians amongst you, my average time per KM is 7 minutes and bear in mind I will more than likely get slower as time goes on!! You can guess any time between 10 hours and 14 hours.<br/><br/>The winner of the sweepstake will get half of the prize money with the rest going to GOSH.<br/><br/>If you would like to take part then message me your name and address (for the medal) and I will send bank transfer details. or via paypal at joymhart@outlook.com<br/><br/>https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/joy-hart2?newPage=True<br/></p>",NA,NA,"Joy's 4x4 x 48 challenge","7.50","0","30","6","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,"On Sunday 12 September I will be running the GNR because It means a lot to me","On Sunday 12 September I will be running the GNR","It means a lot to me",NA,"https://images.justgiving.com/image/9827c9d8-7841-4915-9eea-e2c7e6faa389.jpg","https://images.justgiving.com/image/9827c9d8-7841-4915-9eea-e2c7e6faa389.jpg?template=size150x150face",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
