I'll be joined by my friends too, so it shouldn't be boring. <br /><br />In the past, I've released music and donated all the proceeds to this charity, and I recently went sober for October and in total we raised over £400.

I watched one of my closest friends, progress and achieve so much in this sport and guaranteed a place in the London Marathon. For anyone who knows me, I am extremely competitive and thought right, I want to do the exact same and I want a place in the London Marathon. That was the dream! <br/><br/>I am extremely lucky and privileged to have  secured a place for London Marathon 4th October 2021 for the charity Guide Dogs. The reason why I wanted to fundraise for this amazing cause is because guide dogs play a vital role in helping those who are visually inpaired.<br/><br/>Despite the devastation caused by loss of sight, 70% of adults receive no support within the first 12 months of diagnosis, and are likely to encounter poor education, high unemployment, depression, loneliness and financial insecurity throughout their lifetime. Childhood sight loss is on the increase. There are around 35,000 children and young people living with a vision impairment in the UK. Some 80% of a child’s learning takes place using vision, and every day they go without support can affect their development.<br/><br/>In 2018, it cost around £63,000 to breed, train and support a guide dog from birth to retirement, however, the cost of a guide dog is impacted not just by the cost of breeding and training, but also the cost of all of our support functions for the partnership over an average of seven years, as well as external support such as food and vets’ bills. A guide dog owner may have as many as eight guide dogs in their lifetime bringing the total cost to around £500,000.<br/><br/>On a daily basis we take our eye sight for granted and the thought will never cross our minds that one day we may occur serious problems with our vision. If you have a serious visual impairment, a guide dog can help you become more independent and mobile. Highly trained to support you in navigating any mobility challenges you may face, guide dogs are a great way to get you out and about with confidence.<br/><br/>I would really appreciate any donation for this great cause, nothing is too small, please help me raise my target of £2000 and I will promise to complete that finishing line in style!<br/><br/>Thank you in advance for all your support.<br/><br/><br/>Hayley/DJ Hailz<br/><br/><br/><!--/data/user/0/com.samsung.android.app.notes/files/clipdata/clipdata_bodytext_201206_195551_532.sdocx--><br/></p>","Hayley running for Guide Dogs!","0","0","0","0","0","true","true","https://images.justgiving.com/image/855a277c-ac1f-4a38-bf22-2ea063a8eebc.jpg","https://images.justgiving.com/image/855a277c-ac1f-4a38-bf22-2ea063a8eebc.jpg?template=size150x150face",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
