My younger brother was only 6 weeks old when whilst walking with the pushchair my Mum's leg broke causing her to fall. She was diagnosed with bone cancer at the age of 34.</span></p><p><span style=""background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245);"">Her first hospital stay lasted 14 weeks.  Precious time when she should have been with her newborn baby and young family. She then bravely endured chemotherapy, radiotherapy and some of the most invasive prosthetic surgery carried out at the time to replace her knee and hip bones. She was a fighter! After a remission period of only 1 year, bone cancer struck again in her other leg and she lost her hard fought battle.</span></p><p><span style=""background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245);"">14th September this year marked 34 years since cancer took my mum away, and all the special times we should have shared together. She survived just long enough to see my little brother in his reception school uniform.</span></p><p><span style=""background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245);"">Cancer also tried to take my Dad away. He was just 27 when he developed Hodgkin's Lymphoma but fortunately in his case the radiotherapy was successful.</span></p><p><span style=""background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245);"">I was very close to my Auntie Maggie. She had 3 sons and I had 2 brothers so we enjoyed our 'girl's time' together. She helped to look after us during school holidays when we would go and stay with her. They felt very special times. I was only 14 when she developed an aggressive brain tumour and died shortly after. She was only 51.</span></p><p><span style=""background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245);"">I must also pay tribute to my Gran and Linda, who were such amazing women and the 'mother figures' in my life. Their kindness, strength, compassion and resilience knew no bounds, but unfortunately they both also lost their battles to cancer.</span></p><p><span style=""background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245);"">We will all have our own stories of how cancer has touched our lives. Cancer may attack an individual but the ripple effects for friends and families are wide spread and devastating.</span></p><p><span style=""background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245);"">Macmillan understand how cancer can affect people's lives - their health, money, job and family. They are there to support people through their darkest times. A Macmillan nurse costs £221 per day. If we can raise enough money to fund 2 days of essential support that would be amazing!</span></p><p><span style=""background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245);"">Thank very much you. </span></p><p><span style=""background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245);"">Helen Xx</span></p><!--EndFragment--><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><span>Thanks for supporting my fundraising.

I can only imagine people with cancer are anxious about the impact of coronavirus on their treatment and care. Life presently is so challenging without having to worry additionally about being diagnosed or treated for cancer. </p><p>Sadly cancer for me is all too familiar a disease. My father passed away 10 years ago from stomach cancer, and this past year my father in law has been dealing with treatment for colon cancer. Not to mention the many friends and family members I know who have also fought their own battles with this horrible disease.</p><p>As we move into lockdown 2 fitness and working out may not be at the forefront of everyone's mind. And even for those who do workout regularly motivation may be beginning to wane with the current closure of gyms. So myself and my friend came up with the idea of completing forty days of fitness to help others and ourselves stay committed to being healthy.</p><p>Throughout the first lockdown is when I began running. I have always been active and a member of the gym but I had never ran anywhere but on a treadmill. I began walking everyday for 5km, which slowly turned into running and eventually transformed into running 10km 4 to 5 days a week. </p><p>I have decided to put my new found love for running to good use and start this campaign. I won't lie this is going to be a real struggle for me but I am determined to succeed. </p><p>Thanks for supporting my fundraising.

Or are you just interested in hearing what I think you should absolutely never buy anyone for Christmas? If you answered yes to any of those, my gift consultation services are for you! We can sit down and have a nice chat over the phone or Zoom/Skype/similar and I’ll help you make some progress.

During December hundreds of our fundraising dogs across the UK would usually be out and about wagging their tails and meeting you at supermarket and street collections, Christmas fairs and festive coffee mornings. Our four-legged fundraisers support the 400+ fundraising groups across the UK from Glasgow to Plymouth and everywhere in between.

Due to the current situation, most of our fundraising groups will not be out collecting this festive season, and our four-legged fundraisers will be very much missed! We hope you will do your bit and help us as we aim to raise enough for 12 new guide dog partnerships! Heres how you can join in: 

	Donate £12 and share our posts across social media nominating a friend, family member or colleague to  get involved

You can choose to Run100, Cycle100 or Swim100 between 1 July and 31 November. However you take on your 100, get sponsored to do it and help us supporting people living with sight loss. 

You could complete 100 metres, 100 minutes, 100 days  be creative!

The sponsorship money you raise will make a difference. £100 could pay for five hours' training at a Guide Dogs training school.

It's thanks to people like you that we can continue to provide life-changing services, like our guide dogs, to people with sight loss. So, a huge thank you and lots of luck for your challenge!
