The enthusiasm, support and hard work of M&S employees and customers has raised an incredible £19.4 million for Macmillan to date. In 2019 alone, the fantastic £2.1 million raised by M&S was enough to fund around 37 Macmillan professionals for one year, from nurses and occupational therapists to psychologists and doctors to provide vital support for people living with cancer.

With Coronavirus having had a huge impact on fundraising events, your support has never been more important, as we safeguard against cancer becoming the forgotten C. With social distancing measures in place, this year, were challenging M&S colleagues to get creative with their fundraising and activities, using virtual challenges and digital channels to make the most of their efforts this year!

Virtual fundraising challenges like Dechox are a way to help us keep up the pace of progress. Your willpower will be funnelled into groundbreaking science and support for the people who need us most. Because despite everything else happening at the moment, heart and circulatory diseases are still the worlds biggest killers.

I'm raising money for the British Heart Foundation and I'd be so grateful for your support. The BHF has helped halve the number of people dying from heart and circulatory disease in the UK but sadly every day hundreds of people lose their lives. It's only thanks to support from people like us that the BHF can create new treatments and discover new cures. £24 could pay for two hours of research by an early career scientist, but every pound helps so please give what you can to help me hit my target. The reason I have chosen this charity is because my Grandad sadly passed away in March this year, he had multiple strokes and it was devastating for us all. My Grandma also has heart complications and has suffered a cardiac arrest, this happened around the same time my Grandad was having his strokes, but with thanks to the paramedics, they managed to bring her back round. As you know, The British Heart Foundation covers both strokes and any heart complications/cardiac arrests which is why this is my chosen charity. I will be skydiving March 2021 to mark the first anniversary of my Grandads passing. The skydive is fully funded for by myself and all donations made will be going directly to The British Heart Foundation.

Many suffer from depression and struggle with feelings of isolation. 

Guide Dogs is here to help solve this problem. We provide individual support that overcomes the emotional and physical challenges faced by people living with sight loss. 

We work for a world where people with sight loss are never left out of life. We work for a world where blind people no longer feel invisible, where the quality of their eye sight is genuinely the only difference between them and the rest of society. 

A world with enough support to make the challenges of sight loss no barrier to fulfilling your needs and dreams. A world where being blind or partially sighted isn't what defines you.

Covid 19 'Lockdown' from 23rd March was a great incentive to get out 3 or 4 times a week, especially when taking outside exercise on one's own was deemed to be acceptable by Boris &amp; Co and with the spring and summer weather being so good. Doing a 4 mile walk in under 1 hour, back in May,  helped me raise £100 for the Elizabeth House Adult Day Centre in Cookham with the sponsorship of Barn Close residents, and gave me the urge to take on even bigger challenges. Reading about the forthcoming annual Maidenhead Boundary Walk in the local paper, a few weeks ago, was just the incentive I needed. As usual, the Walk is organised by Maidenhead Rotary, but has been modified so as to be Covid friendly. As a result, at 13 miles, the Walk is slightly shorter and can be undertaken on any day of my choice between 4th and 25th October. Yes, I can, hopefully, avoid any of the crowded family days and any bad weather, but I shall still be required to prove that I have done the Walk before I can start pestering those who have agreed to sponsor me! (There will be photographic evidence on this page). All in all, the <u>cause</u> is a good one, the <u>course</u> is delightfully scenic (Penny and I completed the last of four walks to recce the circuit earlier today) and, above all, I'm up for it. All being well, next Thursday 15th October (anniversary of my father's passing) will be the big day. Wish me luck and sponsor me generously if you possibly can.

RNLI lifeboats in the South West protect hundreds of communities through their 24-hour search and rescue service. They rely on the safest, most reliable lifeboats and modern stations to launch from. 
The stunning coastline of Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Somerset, Isles of Scilly and the Channel Islands are enjoyed by millions of people from across the country every year. But the water remains an unpredictable environment that can catch people out. People will always need our help and we will always be there to answer that call.

At first I was fed up, then, talking to my kids, I realised what a privilege it is to expect hot and cold running water 24/7. I carried <i>one</i> bucket of water in from my garden to flush our toilets, and wondered what it would be like to have to walk miles carrying water every day. I asked my kids to use hand sanitiser before eating, and wondered what it would be like to worry constantly about them getting ill from dirty water, or not having enough water to keep clean. </p><p>Here's what WaterAid say: <br/>Clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene should be a normal part of everyone’s daily life. Without all three, people can’t live dignified, healthy lives. With all three, they can unlock their potential, break free from poverty and change their lives for good.With clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene, children are born healthier. They get the chance to go to school and grow up to become adults. Women and men get to earn a living. Whole communities start to thrive. It sounds normal and it should be.</p><p>So rather than just thinking about it, I decided to do something, and this felt like a small thing I could do that others might want to do too. </p>","East London burst pipe - Water Aid","86.25","0","415","83","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"I am asking for donations because everyone should have access to clean water","I am asking for donations",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"everyone should have access to clean water",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
