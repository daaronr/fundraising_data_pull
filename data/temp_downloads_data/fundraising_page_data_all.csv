Yes you guessed it - I will aim to play the violin throughout.  I know, I’m completely mental!!! <br/><br/>This charity does so much for those suffering with cancer. I have been very fortunate not to have had it but so many people close to me have - some with amazing success stories and some not so lucky. Macmillan offer support right from the moment someone is diagnosed and no-one ever realises how much they need that support until they are in that position.<br/><br/>Any donation you make will be greatly appreciated and will help Macmillan to support more people affected by cancer in many ways.  The following are just an example:<br/><br/>£5.40 will fund 10 copies of Macmillan's cancer guide.<br/>£16 will fund Macmillan's online community for 1 hour.<br/>£32 will fund a Macmillan Nurse for 1 hour.<br/><br/>Thank you all so much for your support!

Every little bit helps. Thank you for your support. Below is some information about Macmillan Cancer Support. There’s around 3 million people living with cancer in the UK today, and over 360,000 more are diagnosed every year. Right now, millions of people with cancer are counting on Macmillan for physical, financial and emotional support. At Macmillan, they do whatever it takes – last year was no exception. But they can't do it alone. Macmillan is facing a huge drop in income as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Because 97% of their work is funded by people like us, they need our support now more than ever.

After noticing a sore which didn't heal my husband tried to convince me to go to the doctors. I eventually overcame my embarrassment and went, after putting it off and putting it off and then got referred to Princess Anne Hospital, Southampton. The news was then broken to me. I had cancer. My whole world seemed to fall apart. It was possible that I only had a limited time left and I would only know which way things would go after surgery.I was told I would need surgery asap and 5/6 weeks later I had surgery to remove an SCC. Fortunately it was good news and they managed to remove it all....albeit very painful and having to be bedridden for what seemed an eternity.</p><p>Macmillan were there for me from day 1 if I needed them. They provided me with all the information of my diagnosis, the treatment, prognosis and life after surgery. Macmillan were there.</p><p>Four years later I have just reduced my reviews with my consultant from 3 monthly to 6 monthly and things are looking good.</p><p>We must not be embarrassed to talk to people about problems. If I had left it much longer, things would have been very different. </p><p>Macmillan helped with that and I would like to give something back to help others</p><p>Macmillan give people with cancer everything.

It's only thanks to support from people like us that the BHF can create new treatments and discover new cures. £24 could pay for two hours of research by an early career scientist, but every pound helps so please give what you can to help me hit my target. Thanks!","jose's Get Those Bones Moving","27.50","0","110","0","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I found this hard, especially in bad weather, but very therapeutic and In memory of my wee Mum, I have decided to continue my walk into November and use it to fundraise for the BHF. I would be very grateful for any amount you could kindly donate, however small,  knowing this may help save others in the future. We also lost my Dad to a heart attack, who passed  at a very young age therefore it is vitally important to support this cause to save others. Please note I will post updates regularly on my Facebook page. </p><p><span>The BHF has helped halve the number of people dying from heart and circulatory disease in the UK but sadly every day hundreds of people lose their lives.

This is the term for when the skull fuses together prematurely, before brain growth. My skull was fixed in a ridge at the top, which meant it had none of the flexibility of a normal newborn's skull. There was a likelihood that I would be brain-damaged, and have both sight and hearing impairments. Luckily, I was a Caesarian birth (because of complications at the birth of my older brother). This ended up being a blessing in disguise: if I had travelled down the birth canal, my bones wouldn't have crossed over, meaning that my eye sockets would probably have been crushed, and my nose and forehead would have collapsed.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span style=""color: #000000;background-color: transparent;"">A brain scan showed that my brain had luckily not been damaged and it would grow normally. After three months of tests it was also clear that I had no hearing or sight defects. However my parents were still stuck with the decision of what to do about the shape of my head. It looked fine as a baby - a little pointed; but as I grew it would grow too, and because of the fusion, it would grow abnormally. At 5 months old I spent a week in Great Ormond Street Hospital (one of two places in the country that specialise in Craniosynostosis) to undergo an operation which consisted of cutting across from ear to ear so that the whole chunk of bone that was fused could be cut through, and then the front and back would be pushed together to rebuild the part that had been fused. I went for consistent check ups up until the age of 18 months - which is when my parents were told that, other than the scar going across the length of my head, I will be fine. All thanks to the amazing work from the doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span style=""color: #000000;background-color: transparent;"">I’m running the London Landmarks Half Marathon on April 3rd in aid of The Great Ormond Street Hospital Charity, an extraordinary hospital which has always depended on charitable support to give seriously ill children the best chance to fulfil their potential.

The amazing staff who took care of Louie and in particular a surgeon by the name of Paolo De Coppi is the reason I’d like to help raise money so as this amazing facility can help to take care of the children in need. <br/><br/>My brother Louie suffered a severe case of septicaemia and because of Great Ormond Street we can thank them for the reason that he is still here today.<br/><br/>Thank you for your support. I've included information about Great Ormond Street Hospital and Children's Charity below. <br/><br/>Every day brings new challenges at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH). Every day, 619 children and young people from across the UK arrive for life-changing treatments. <br/><br/>Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity raises money to enable the hospital to provide world class care and to pioneer new treatments and cures for childhood illnesses.<br/><br/>Any donation is greatly appreciated xx<br/></p><p><span>Ps </span><span>This is the same fundraiser as the one on my Facebook page!!</span><br/></p>","Lily's 500 000 steps in November for GOSH","78.75","0","405","405","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

He went on to have multiple respiratory arrests and trips to hospital, having to be resuscitated by his mum on 2 more of those occasions. </div><div dir=""auto"" style=""color: rgb(33, 33, 33);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><br/></div><div dir=""auto"" style=""color: rgb(33, 33, 33);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Following an appointment with his paediatric consultant, Henry was referred to the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford for further tests on his heart. Whilst waiting for his appointment he had a further respiratory arrest at home and was transferred by ambulance directly to Oxford. Flowing scans and x-rays, the cardiac team diagnosed a vascular ring compressing his trachea and oesophagus, this was caused by him having been born with a double aortic arch. He was transferred to GOSH, to have an excision of his left arch and Kommerell's diverticulum.</div><div dir=""auto"" style=""color: rgb(33, 33, 33);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><br/></div><div dir=""auto"" style=""color: rgb(33, 33, 33);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Surgeons stated the compression of his windpipe was very severe, as it was less than 1mm in diameter and he was lucky to have survived. </div><div dir=""auto"" style=""color: rgb(33, 33, 33);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><br/></div><div dir=""auto"" style=""color: rgb(33, 33, 33);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Henry seemed well after his surgery but was rushed back to hospital a week after his discharge following another respiratory arrest and resuscitation at home. He had another arrest at hospital, requiring immediate treatment. Henry was transferred back to GOSH where they found he would need further surgery to release adhesions of the Left Subclavian Artery and an Aortopexy. </div><div dir=""auto"" style=""color: rgb(33, 33, 33);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);""><br/></span></div><div dir=""auto"" style=""color: rgb(33, 33, 33);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);"">During his last procedure, the surgeon had to remove his Thymus gland to perform the Aortopexy.

We have decided to run for 3 separate charities that are close to our hearts. </p><p>I have decided to run for Great Ormond Street Hospital, a hospital that treats childhood illnesses. The hospital receives over 230,000 outpatient visits and over 40,000 inpatient visits annually. This world-class hospital helps find new treatments through continuous research. </p><p><span>This run is in memory of my beautiful friend Addie Brady, who sadly lost her battle to a brain tumour in 2018. </span><br/></p><p><span></span></p><p style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">In 2011, Addie was diagnosed with a rare form of bone cancer called spindle cell sarcoma. She underwent surgery that removed her tibia bone and was replaced with a titanium metal. All was well and Addie continued with her life, grateful for things getting back to normal.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p><p style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">However, in 2016 when Addie was at a family party she appeared to be in a trance like state. This was followed by a number of seizures in the ambulance whilst she was being rushed to hospital. From there, she was transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital to discover an aggressive, high grade, inoperable tumour. To everyone’s surprise this was unrelated to the first cancer. Addie was diagnosed Li-Fraumeni Sydnrome also known as LFS, an inherited familial predisposition. LFS occurs due to a mutation in a tumour suppressor gene called TP53. Addie was given 12-18 months to live. Despite Addie and her family’s urge to find more extensive treatment, there was nothing in or outside the UK.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p><p style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Addie underwent radiotherapy and chemotherapy and remained stable for just over a year. However, it became aggressive very quickly. After more scans, they found that the tumour had spread to her spine. This took over her mobility, sight and mind.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p><p style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Addie unfortunately passed away on 1<sup>st</sup><span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span>February 2018 in her home at the age of 16.</p><p style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Addie was the most extraordinary, beautiful, crazy and loving girl. She is loved and missed by everyone everyday. Her laugh was infectious and her smile lit up the room. Memories I made with Addie will never leave, I do not know anyone that made me laugh as much as she did. I am so thankful that she came into my life and had such a great impact, as she did with everyone that she met. </p><p style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Through fundraising for this run, it will help other people like Addie.

Half of those who drown never intend on entering the water. These are wasted lives; preventable deaths. And this needs to change.The RNLI is the charity that saves lives at sea. Last year, brave volunteer crew across Scotland launched to the rescue of people in danger 1,071 times; thats 3 launches each and every day of the year. Why? Because RNLI lifeboat crews are determined to save every one.As a charity, the RNLI receives no government funding and needs to raise an average £155,000 per year to run just one lifeboat station each year. With 46 lifeboat stations in Scotland, the RNLI needs our support to power its lifesaving service.</span></p>","RNLI Islay Fundraising St. Andrews Day Raffle 2021","0","0","420","168","0","https://images.justgiving.com/image/e5d46585-59da-487a-9b24-13d7c0434702.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true","https://images.justgiving.com/image/e5d46585-59da-487a-9b24-13d7c0434702.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true","The Islay RNLI Fundraisers are raising funds because our volunteers are saving lives every day.","The Islay RNLI Fundraisers are raising funds","our volunteers are saving lives every day.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"0178fe3a-3198-4ea0-8868-5e65567da336","https://images.justgiving.com/image/de1e330f-000a-4a3e-8fe9-808843eec414.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true","https://images.justgiving.com/image/de1e330f-000a-4a3e-8fe9-808843eec414.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The community of Looe, his family and friends , have lost a diamond, wonderful friend, a  fishermen of the Cornish sea. Mick was a kind,  gentleman and made any person feel comfortable in his presence. His patience and wisdom teaching beginners and helping keen fishermen to reel in their catch and bait up always came with wise words of how to catch the &#34;big one&#34; along with lots of banter allowing each person on the boat feeling confident the next bite was the catch of the day. An experienced fishing mentor who shared many stories and experiences with the next person.</span></p><p>As beautiful as any flower can be, there's no color, or big enough size of flower to personify Mick's passing, so we have decided to raise funds and collect donations to go towards the RNLI  fund so Mick's legendary life can live on and continue to be remembered and celebrated. By donating towards the RNLI fund  we will continue to support all the wonderful traits Mick displayed and believed in. To help your fellow man, to be safe at sea, to enjoy and appreciate the wonderful ocean with respect of it's natural force. To be kind, caring and to share what the beauty of the ocean can give to man. Your RNLI donation would be greatly appreciated in lieu of flowers and we continue to honour Mick and our beautiful shores.<br/></p><p><span>In 2010 the D-Class Inshore Lifeboat Ollie Naismith was officially named and went on service at Looe. The lifeboat was named after a popular local teenager Ollie Naismith who sadly died in a tragic road traffic accident in 2009. Ollies parents, Maxine and John Naismith spearheaded a fundraising campaign to raise the funds for the lifeboat which has gone on to save many lives in and around Looe including the life of Louis Webber, a young local lad who was of a similar age to Ollie. The lifeboat is now coming to the end of its operational life so the team at Looe Lifeboat station are teaming up with the Naismiths and Webber family to launch the Looe Lifeboat Appeal to raise the £78,000 required to provide a replacement lifeboat which will be named the Ollie Naismith II.Your donation to this community appeal will help to fund this lifeboat which will continue the selfless work of our volunteer lifeboat crew in Looe.</span><br/></p>","In Loving memory of Micky","12.50","0","60","0","0",NA,NA,"Raising money for the new Looe Lifeboat because It was a cause that meant a lot to Micky.","Raising money for the new Looe Lifeboat","It was a cause that meant a lot to Micky.","916759","Mick Hood","/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/14825428","remember/916759","3b8ff11c-ca1f-4502-9bcd-8ac34aada7e2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
