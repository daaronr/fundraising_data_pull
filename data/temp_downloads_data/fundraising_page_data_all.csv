You know I really heart dancing - I know some of you openly admit that you do too and few others of you secretly enjoy a sly shimmy in private - and that's ok. It is a great way to de-stress and I don't know anyone who after dancing, says that they regret it (except me after doing my first Oops Upside Your Head at Shane's 50th when I did my back in!). If you joined me a few years ago when I danced for a few other related causes and a couple of special men in my life, I am made up that you are still here. I have been really touched at the big love and support you have all given me over the last few months.
