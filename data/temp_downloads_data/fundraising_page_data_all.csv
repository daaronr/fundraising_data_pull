Many years ago my mum and my auntie decided to run the race for life, and one night I went along to training. And they howled with laughter when I tried to run for all of 15 seconds and quit. This memory, this laughter got me through my first ever 5k in May, and my 10k in September and it will hopefully get me through all 13.1 miles of this too! </p><p>Many of you know I lost my mum and that laughter on June 22nd 2017. Some of you may not know about the 3 weeks before that which my mum spent in a hospice. We could not have been more grateful for that place. My <span>mum hated the hospital and refused to go back which is how she ended up surrounded by the caring, loving, truly amazing staff who became her friends at the very worst point of her life. At the end I spent a full 72 hours in that place, and they couldn’t have done more for me. These people are truly the best of the human race. </span></p><p><span>So I’m putting myself through hell to raise money for the people who held my hand the last time I went through it, and I hope you’ll help me.</span></p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.
