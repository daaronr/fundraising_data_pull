Throughout the last few weeks, she has been nothing short of inspirational with her strength, positivity and thoughtfulness for others during what has been an extremely stressful and difficult time. One aspect that has been a challenge, has been coming to terms with the imminent loss of her infamous bleached blonde locks as a result of the Chemotherapy. Therefore, we decided as a way of making light of this less than ideal situation, on Monday 11th January I will shave off my hair at the same time that my mum says goodbye to hers. This way we can enjoy lockdown together and laugh at our new appearances (and watch my hair grow back). This is in aid of Macmillan Cancer Research, the Number 1 cancer charity in the UK and therefore, if you could spare any money at all for a donation, it would be hugely appreciated and incredibly generous.</p>","Freddie's Brave the Shave - Lockdown 3","443.75","0","2500","250","0","OtherPersonalChallenge",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"true",NA,"https://images.justgiving.com/image/f9dcc813-fded-46f0-86bd-d71d06f4d4ca.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true",NA,"https://images.justgiving.com/image/f9dcc813-fded-46f0-86bd-d71d06f4d4ca.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It was meant to be their last appointment but the nurse's keen eye spotted something not quiet right. It turns out it was cancer and luckily for the person spotted soon enough. <br/></p><p>As a thank you to that nurse I've decided to cycle an hour everyday for 41 days, starting on the 1st of February. I know it doesn't sound much but those of you who know me will know thats a lot for me. The last time I did any sort of meaningful cycling was 3 years ago when I took part in the British Heart Foundation 30 mile Cotswold bike challenge. I haven't really rode since.<br/></p><p>So, you may be asking why 41 days and why February. Well I shall tell you. I'm 41 or will be in the start of February and there you have my only bit of logic. <br/></p><p>IF, someone sponsors me enough or I reach my target of raising £150 before the end of the 41 days, I will cycle for another 29 days. And that there is a promise. I'm also interested to see who read all of this :-)</p><p><br/></p><p>Thanks for supporting my fundraising.

Without the amazing help and research that British heart foundation does there is a possibility I wouldn’t have been here today. Thanks to them I had amazing surgery to save my life and now use a pacemaker to keep my heart going. If this research was never made multiple people wouldn’t be with us today. And with your donations over the years the treatment for heart conditions have advanced so much, in 2005 when I had my surgery I had to have open heart surgery. And now they can do those type of surgeries using key hole surgery techniques. British heart foundation is helping tackle conditions that are shockingly common amongst us, in hopes we can have a future of healthy hearts and a health nation. <br />Thank you for reading my story, and thank you for continuing another.","Erin's step challenge for British heart foundation","0","0","0","0","0","Walks",NA,"100000 because Steps","100000","Steps",NA,NA,"true",NA,"https://images.justgiving.com/image/36e3bbd0-aec3-4f2a-abd5-1146be2bd65d.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true",NA,"https://images.justgiving.com/image/36e3bbd0-aec3-4f2a-abd5-1146be2bd65d.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true","482ae02d-c33e-467f-8285-8490e798b479",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

But unfortunately the disease had come to its natural end and my Nan sadly passed away in her sleep peacefully on the 29th Dec 20.  The only saving grace is she is out of pain and now at peace.</p><p>The point of this page is to try and raise some funds towards future research for Heart Disease but the British Heart Foundation. All funds will go direct to the British Heart Foundation.</p><p>This has been created in preparation for my Nan's Funeral on the 20th Jan 2021 at Selby Abbey, before been laid to rest with her soul mate my Grandad.</p>","In memory of Eunice Brown aka Supernan","55","0","450","225","0","InMemory","Eunice  Brown","Opportunity to raise some money for heart disease because my Nan has sadly suffering from Heart Disease","Opportunity to raise some money for heart disease","my Nan has sadly suffering from Heart Disease","https://images.justgiving.com/image/e9e31c7e-fd0e-4d1a-af83-3091cf879edd.jpg","https://images.justgiving.com/image/e9e31c7e-fd0e-4d1a-af83-3091cf879edd.jpg?template=size150x150face",NA,NA,"https://images.justgiving.com/image/36a06ed4-3fd3-4209-8dcd-9c34462b402a.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true",NA,"https://images.justgiving.com/image/36a06ed4-3fd3-4209-8dcd-9c34462b402a.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Hospice is often very different from what people expect  it is a warm, friendly space with beautiful gardens, delicious home-cooked food and personalised care. Every person is treated as an individual and helped to reach their goals and fulfil their wishes. A team of nurses, doctors, social workers, physiotherapists, chaplains, bereavement counsellors and pharmacists work together, putting every person at the centre of their care.  

Throughout Covid-19 Bradford Hospice teams have been working around the clock to continue supporting local people. Death, dying and bereavement is at the forefront of peoples minds and Marie Curie knows what a difference the right care at the end of life can make.  
 
They cant do any of this without your support.

I went from living a busy and active lifestyle to being housebound, unable to walk, and unable to care for myself. Nature became my everyday escape, something I had always loved was still there and still accessible in some ways to me. I might not have been able to go outside for such a long time but I could bird watch from my windows, I could listen to the wildlife and feel the fresh air with my window open, I could watch the seasons change and the life in my little garden adapt through each season. Three years later I have learnt to walk again, I’m strong enough to do it (often with the aid of my stick) and regularly potter off to enjoy my local park just in the company of my dog on a good day.</b></p><p><b>It took time but through this battle nature has been such a blessing for me. It became part of my goals; first getting out into the garden in my wheelchair to sit and enjoy the fresh air, next it was taking a few steps into the garden with a walking aid as I became stronger and learnt to take one step after another, then having the confidence to take a mobility scooter and, under supervision, ride it up to the park and eventually start to take tentative steps on paths with a slight incline, next it was building up stamina and learning to climb up and down steps. Anytime I needed to have a break I could just stop and watch nature change and grow around me as my life did the same. </b><br/></p><p><span><b>Throughout the last three lockdowns and all of 2020, surrounded by nature and the support of loved ones, I’ve gone from strength to strength and have made some massive steps forward (pun intended). COVID may have put a restriction on the intended date for ‘The Big Winter Wander’ and what exactly can be done but here’s the plan; </b></span></p><p><span><b>. Initially WWF-UK had planned for the event to take place on Sunday the 24th of January but, following lockdown 3.0 they have decided to reschedule the event with a date TBC. However, per their update and email, if people can safely still take part they are welcome to at anytime and in various ways with all fundraising still going towards the cause. In order to stick to lockdown legislation and Government guidelines I have decided to do my walk over the period of a week starting on Monday the 18th of January and ending on Sunday the 24th of January. This will be my legally allowed and COVID safe one outdoor exercise activity per day. </b></span></p><p><span><b>. This will be a huge challenge for me covering four miles a day for seven consecutive days totalling 28 miles over the week. Baring in mind this time last year I was still regularly using my wheelchair I do have to ensure my safety so some days I will be joined (socially distanced) by a member of my support bubble, each day I will have my dog with me as company, and for every walk I will also be using my walking stick for support. </b></span></p><p><span><b>. I will be walking the same route each day around Wollaton Park in Nottingham which is a three minute walk from my house and is therefore within my local area and adheres to COVID regulations. </b></span></p><p><span><b>. Although I have the sheets for fundraising because of being unable to meet people outside of my bubble I have to rely on online donations so, if you do very nicely choose to sponsor me, please do so via my Just Giving page www.justgiving/francescarachel</b></span></p><p><br/></p>","Francesca Rachel Does The Big Winter Wander","2.50","0","15","38","0","Walks",NA,"Raising money because nature needs us!","Raising money","nature needs us!","https://images.justgiving.com/image/c566d660-c2c5-4545-bb4e-3e3e1081f613.jpg","https://images.justgiving.com/image/c566d660-c2c5-4545-bb4e-3e3e1081f613.jpg?template=size150x150face","true",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
