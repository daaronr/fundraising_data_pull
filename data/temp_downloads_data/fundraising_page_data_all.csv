We’ll be going on a series of hikes over the course of November with a target of 100 miles all together. We’ll be documenting all our walks on Facebook and Instagram for you to see, so join us on this journey, every Sunday (at the least).</span></p><p>We’ve chosen to support Macmillan because their mission means a lot to me, they’re a great charity that support so many people and do so many amazing things. In the last 3 years they have supported my family many times. In 2017, my Mum, the amazing Deborah, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, with her tumour growing from the size of a coconut to looking pregnant with quintuplets within a few weeks. After a few months of chemotherapy, My Mum was back on her feet. Not without the support of Macmillan, they invited Deborah to look good feel better sessions. These sessions showed my Mum how to apply eyebrows when there’s no hair, eyeliner and gave her a makeover, they also held a session on tying a headscarf and gave her the opportunity to learn how to care for and wear wigs. These sessions also give women who are fighting cancer a chance to have a chat and a laugh. Giving our peanut the confidence to embrace her baldness. November 29th will be a year since my Grandma passed. She received her diagnosis 5 weeks before she died. It was all quite sudden. But Macmillan provided home care, with nurses frequently visiting. Meaning my Grandma passed away in her own home, surrounded by her family. Whilst I was struggling with my bereavement, I spoke to their support team, who directed me to their online community. There, I was encouraged to write a letter for my Grandma and visit her grave, leaving the letter for her to read. This was massive in learning to live with the loss of my Grandma.   </p><p><span>SO.. our plan!</span></p><p><span>1<sup>st</sup> November – Whernside</span></p><p><span>8</span><sup>th</sup><span> November – Frenzy week (Sunday</span></p><p><span>8th – Saturday14th) Going to go on as many walks as we can in one week.
