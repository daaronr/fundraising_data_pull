This in itself is creating a future cancer pandemic. <br /><br />With the physical and financial strain that COVID-19 is putting on our health service, people are already having to wait weeks for treatment plans, some are having treatments cancelled and across the country, every single week people are having operations cancelled in what already is the scariest and most difficult time of their lives, before we even talk about a global pandemic and the challenges that brings. <br /><br />In a time where little fundraising is able to take place due to lockdown restrictions, charity's like Macmillan have never needed our support more. <br /><br />If you can donate the cost of a packet of Christmas cards or a Christmas drink I'd be extremely grateful.

During December hundreds of our fundraising dogs across the UK would usually be out and about wagging their tails and meeting you at supermarket and street collections, Christmas fairs and festive coffee mornings. Our four-legged fundraisers support the 400+ fundraising groups across the UK from Glasgow to Plymouth and everywhere in between.

Due to the current situation, most of our fundraising groups will not be out collecting this festive season, and our four-legged fundraisers will be very much missed! We hope you will do your bit and help us as we aim to raise enough for 12 new guide dog partnerships! Heres how you can join in: 

	Donate £12 and share our posts across social media nominating a friend, family member or colleague to  get involved

You can choose to Run100, Cycle100 or Swim100 between 1 July and 31 November. However you take on your 100, get sponsored to do it and help us supporting people living with sight loss. 

You could complete 100 metres, 100 minutes, 100 days  be creative!

The sponsorship money you raise will make a difference. £100 could pay for five hours' training at a Guide Dogs training school.

It's thanks to people like you that we can continue to provide life-changing services, like our guide dogs, to people with sight loss. So, a huge thank you and lots of luck for your challenge!

With clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene, children are born healthier. They get the chance to go to school and grow up to become adults. Women and men get to earn a living. Whole communities start to thrive.
