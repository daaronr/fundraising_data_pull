He told me I had to go straight to Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge as my optic nerve was extremely inflamed.  Within 24 hours, I was having an emergency MRI scan and was told that the headaches were due to me having too much spinal fluid, which was crushing my optic nerve, and causing tunnel vision in both eyes. I just remember in that moment my world falling apart.  From then on, my husband had to take time off work to take me to appointments and I had to give up my job, which put financial strain on us.  I suddenly went from being a working mum, to a stay at home mum. I also brought my wedding forward by six months because I didn’t want to risk being a blind bride. After months of tests, I was diagnosed with Benign Intracranial Hypertension causing Papilledema and am now blind in my right eye with tunnel vision in my left, something which has been made easier by having a guide dog for support. I now have to take medication every day for the rest of my life to help maintain the vision I do have.  </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>When I qualified with my first guide dog Quaver, it gave me my freedom and my independence back.  Having a guide dog has meant I’ve been able to see my friends again and travel to places like London, without having someone there to hold my hand. </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Guide Dogs have supported me so well and it is now that they need our support more than ever to continue their life changing work to help people like me to gain our independence again.  Our local fundraising group are not able to collect out and about at the moment due to current restrictions and so I invite you to donate via this page to contribute to the charity’s income.</span></p><p><span>Thank you. </span></p><p></p>","Peterborough Guide Dogs Virtual Collection","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"56067dbb-584d-4bed-aa54-75d6865fb3f2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Just £30 could provide a full kit to protect a health-worker on the frontline, including gloves, masks and coveralls, while just £43 could help provide 1,680 pairs of disposable gloves for health workers.
The impact of a large-scale outbreak of coronavirus on children, especially poor and vulnerable children, has been immense. Children are at risk from the disease, but also from the disruption to health and education services, impacts on caregivers, and separation from family members.
Unicef has been working closely with governments and the World Health Organization (WHO) since the start of the coronavirus outbreak. Donations made to my page will help to limit the spread of the virus and reduce the impact on children and families.
