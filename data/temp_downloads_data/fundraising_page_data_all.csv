For colleagues without kids or dogs they can borrow dogs; or walk with their dog-owning support bubbles. There's no excuse not to get out into the winter air and putting the kilometres in!</p><p>And you can help us by donating anything you can for this fabulous charity and helping us reach our goal of £1/kilometre. Anything from £1/100kms, to £1/km, everything is welcome and appreciated! And just think, when it's cold, dark and miserable out there it's us that will be out walking whilst you're tucked up warm and dry... but our dogs will thank you for it, and so will we.</p>","Meet & Engage - Guide Dogs Charity Challenge","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,NA,"https://images.justgiving.com/image/532e7eac-d6aa-422c-802e-3ee9695fdbdf.jpg","https://images.justgiving.com/image/532e7eac-d6aa-422c-802e-3ee9695fdbdf.jpg?template=size150x150face",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"56067dbb-584d-4bed-aa54-75d6865fb3f2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Every day thousands of women and girls, all over the world, have no choice but to walk many miles to fetch water for their families. Water that is often dirty.

Their daily routine deprives them of the chance to have an education, a job, and traps them in a cycle of poverty.

Your support can help build wells and water pumps closer to rural communities so that women and girls dont have to spend their days walking for water, and can plan for a better future.
