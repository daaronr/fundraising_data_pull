Slowing down and putting more lives at risk at a time when hearts need more help than ever. Coronary heart disease is now the leading cause of death world wide. 7.6 million people in the UK are living with heart and circulatory disease and there are 450 deaths every day in the UK from heart attacks, and 1 stroke every 5 minutes. To raise money for this cause I’m attempting to do 2.5 marathons in a day. The race to the stones follows the trail from Lewknor passed Waylands Smithy, Uffington Whitehorse and Barbury Castle before reaching the iconic ancient stone circle at Avebury.

We are raising money for the British Heart Foundation and we'd be immensely grateful for your support. </p><p>As an In-house Legal Team at Secure Trust Bank plc, we were collectively planning a charity challenge in January this year to raise money for a good cause and to get us all outside and moving! We were all going to join in with some promising to run miles and miles each week, and others, like Alan our General Counsel, committing to walking a couple of miles a week. We each had a different target but a challenge for all nevertheless.  That plan was put on hold when very sadly, and very suddenly Alan died just before Christmas. As a team we are re-grouping with some more colleagues and are now even more committed to raising money for two good causes we know Alan would have wholeheartedly supported: the British Heart Foundation and Dementia UK. We are determined to get outside, no matter the weather, and get active to get those miles logged, all whilst remembering Alan who we all miss daily. </p><p>The original plan was to run, cycle or walk the distance between the three offices the STB lawyers work at, which was about 150 miles but we have now increased our target to 500 miles.  Please support us in our challenge and consider donating to one of the nominated charities.  </p><p><span>It is incredibly sad that we lost Alan when he was at the eve of his retirement. In fact sadly, every day, hundreds of people in the UK lose their lives from heart and circulatory disease. <span style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);float: none;"">The BHF has helped halve the number of people dying from heart and circulatory disease in the UK<span> and its </span></span>only thanks to support from people like us that the BHF can create new treatments and discover new cures. £24 could pay for two hours of research by an early career scientist, but every pound helps so please give what you can to help us hit our target.

What I learnt during his time at the heart and lung hospital in London back in January 2016 was that there are a whole array of lung diseases which I hadn’t even heard of and unfortunately they said there was nothing that they could do for him as too much water had entered his lungs and there was very little (2%) functionality left from that organ. </p><p>It’s coming up to his 5th year death anniversary so in his memory I wanted to do something that will help others in a difficult position.<span> He was a fighter and he went on until the very end, he walked until his body could no longer walk! He was my rock and he always encouraged me to be healthy because of what he went through! I want to make him proud!</span></p><p>Anyone who’s lost their loved ones due to this pandemic my heart goes out to you! I pray that we’re all protected from this vicious disease!</p><p><span>I will be giving up chocolate for the whole month of March! Now this is a challenge for me, </span><span>he knew how much of a chocoholic I am and my close family and friends know how much I’m obsessed with anything chocolate! Moving forward- I can do this for him, myself and my children! Please donate generously!
