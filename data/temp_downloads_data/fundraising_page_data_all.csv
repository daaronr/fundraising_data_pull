He was cared for by Marie Curie in his final months and Kirsty said, the hospice gave us our dad back.

When dad was first diagnosed, I felt like my insides had been ripped out, it was a real gut-wrenching moment. He was a single parent and brought us up on his own, so we were all really close.

That was just the best thing ever - he had no distress and we knew they were taking such good care of him.

The Hospice is often very different from what people expect  it is a warm, friendly space with beautiful gardens, delicious home-cooked food and personalised care. Every person is treated as an individual and helped to reach their goals and fulfil their wishes. A team of nurses, doctors, social workers, physiotherapists, chaplains, bereavement counsellors and pharmacists work together, putting every person at the centre of their care.  

Throughout Covid-19 Bradford Hospice teams have been working around the clock to continue supporting local people. Death, dying and bereavement is at the forefront of peoples minds and Marie Curie knows what a difference the right care at the end of life can make.  
 
They cant do any of this without your support.

Shockingly, 1 in 10 people worldwide don't have access to clean water, putting them at risk of diseases.

This is the reality for 785 million people but not just to wash their hands... Some children not being able to attend school because water is the priority.
