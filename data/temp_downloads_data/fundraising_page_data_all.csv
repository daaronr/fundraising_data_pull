I am usually that kind of person who likes to always plan ahead and be prepared. However, this year, nothing is going to plan! 2020 was extremely difficult and unsettling for each one of us.<br/><br/>Therefore, without too much planning and hesitation, I decided to give something back to someone in need by fundraising for the Cancer Research UK charity, which was greatly impacted by Covid-19.<br/><br/>Why did I choose this charity? <br/><br/>In August 2019, my mum was diagnosed with breast cancer. In the last year she has gone through painful treatments, regardless of which she managed to remain both optimistic, hopeful about the future and became much stronger than before. Fortunately, she is well now and we are looking forward to a great family Christmas together. <br/><br/>The  money you give helps to keep the lights on in research centres, keep machines running, meaning that researchers can continue trials to find new treatments for cancer patients.<br/><br/>This weekend, I will be paragliding in Sopot, Bulgaria - situated at the south slopes of more that 500 kilometers long mountain range and I'm not going to lie I am scared out of my wits!<br/><br/>Thank you very much for all of your support!

And we’re keeping our focus on understanding the biology of cancer so we can use this vital knowledge to save more lives.<br/><br/>We’re increasing our research in key areas such as early diagnosis, and hard-to-treat cancers including lung, pancreatic, oesophageal cancers and brain tumours. <br/><br/>We’re developing new tests, surgery and radiotherapy techniques, and cancer drugs. We want to personalise prevention, screening and treatment and bring benefits to patients sooner.<br/><br/>To help accelerate progress, we’ll be investing an additional £50 million a year into new funding schemes for our researchers.
