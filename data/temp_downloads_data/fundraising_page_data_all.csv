The day started out as normal, but upon coming home from nursery it was clear that our 17 month old beautiful little girl Evelyn had become seriously unwell very quickly.</p><p>She was seen immediately in the A&amp;E department at Leicester Royal Infirmary and within minutes I was being rushed off to a room on my own whilst emergency treatment took place to save our daughters life. Her heart rate had increased to 280 bpm and she was at high risk of having a cardiac arrest. They gave her a drug called Amiodarone to bring her heart rate down and back into a normal rhythm and thankfully it worked. At this point it was unclear what had caused this so she was transferred to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit at Leicester Glenfield Hospital which specialises in cardiology.</p><p>During the first few days in hospital many tests on her heart were were carried out to determine a diagnosis, but it was the Ajmaline test that confirmed the consultants suspicions of Brugada Syndrome, which is a rare but serious condition that affects the way electrical signals pass through the heart. It can cause the heart to beat dangerously fast. These unusually fast heartbeats, known as an arrythmia can sometimes be life threatening.</p><p>Between the amazing consultants and staff at Glenfield and Birmingham Children’s Hospital who have only come across a couple of cases in a person so young during their careers, it was agreed that the best course of action was for Evelyn to have open heart surgery for a Subcutaneous Implantable Defibrillator with a pacemaker function fitted, plus lifelong medication of Quinidine. The operation went well and she came home a few days later.</p><p>We are slowly coming to terms with what has happened, and we are hoping that Evelyn will lead a mostly normal life with the defibrillator as her guardian angel if the medication fails to do its job, but this has opened my eyes to the fact that Brugada Syndrome accounts for around 8% off all sudden cardiac deaths in the world, and in the majority of cases is only found discovered when a person’s life has sadly been lost. At present there is no cure, so I want to raise a lot of money and awareness for Brugada and other rare heart conditions so research can be done to stop anyone else from losing a loved one.<br/><br/>We have a long road ahead of us as we are waiting for Evelyn’s genetic test results to come back, and if positive then other family members will be tested, so it’s an anxious time for all involved.<br/><br/>Anyone who is fortunate enough to become a parent wants their child to change the world, and maybe this wasn’t what we had planned, but she will change the world for sure!<br/><br/></p>","Changing the world with Brugada ","88.75","0","425","4","0",NA,NA,"John Anderton, Eleanor Mason",NA,NA,NA,NA,"https://images.justgiving.com/image/73985d66-4cd1-4e47-86db-020a78db318f.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true","https://images.justgiving.com/image/73985d66-4cd1-4e47-86db-020a78db318f.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true","50f74d1d-0aba-46e7-8d79-49154c1c0a3c",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our hospice nurses, doctors and therapists provide the best possible care for people with serious illnesses, and offer vital emotional support for them and their families. The hospice is a warm, welcoming place where loved ones can be together in peaceful surroundings and in as much comfort as possible. Whether it's for one day or several weeks, the time people spend at the hospice is precious, and is cherished by them and their families.Thank you for supporting us, and helping to make sure more people with a terminal illness in North London get the care and support they need.&#34;When I was admitted, I was confined to a wheelchair, in constant pain.
