The Coronavirus Pandemic this year has significantly impacted the monies being donated to these worthwhile charities - money that is desperately needed to continue research and support functions of those charities.

Therefore the PENTEN and OITC teams have proposed a ""Virtual"" event where people may take part on the same day but in their own time whilst maintaining social distancing rules

OCD shift workers may also choose a different day to take part

Therefore for 2020 we will be raising money for the British Heart Foundation There is a choice of three events - indoor or outdoor

Cycling

Challenge 1 - Minimum 20 miles

Challenge 2 - Minimum 50 miles

Running

Challenge 1 - Minimum 5K

Challenge 2 - Minimum 10K

Walking

Challenge 1 - Minimum 5K

Challenge 2 - Minimum 10K

The event will take part on the 28th November 2020

So please join the Team and raise money as much money as possible for an extremely worthwhile cause

There is a small joining fee of £10 which of course will go towards the total raised.

So please register and Join in have fun and support a worthy cause!!!

I'm raising money for the British Heart Foundation and I'd be really grateful for your support. The BHF has helped halve the number of people dying from heart and circulatory disease in the UK but sadly every day hundreds of people lose their lives. It's only thanks to support from people like us that the BHF can create new treatments and discover new cures. £24 could pay for two hours of research by an early career scientist, but every pound helps so please give what you can to help me hit my target. Thanks!</p>","Lisa's London Landmarks Half - Donate Now!","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

D-class lifeboats are fundamental to the search and rescue service provided at Blackpool.  The D-class lifeboat first came to Blackpool in 1964 and have rescued hundreds of people and saved many lives over the years.  Colin Lowe, volunteer lifeboat helm said Our D class lifeboats enable us to carry out lifesaving rescues in the tricky surf conditions at Blackpool.  Without the unique capabilities of this class of lifeboat we simply couldnt help the number of people that we do.  We are hoping to raise £52,000 for a new D class lifeboat to continue saving lives at sea in Blackpool.  

Every little helps, thank you so much for your support. ","Keith's Walk 150 Miles in 30 Days page","19.88","0","94.50","38","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"7fbd137c-ae04-40c7-b44c-99bc3a4f26bb",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The global human cost of the pandemic is incomprehensible and a stark reminder that to some extent we are all at the mercy of nature. </p><p>COVID-19 and Climate Change are both global challenges which pose a threat to human existence and require a united effort to find solutions (UNICEF, 2020). More generally there is evidence that climate change and human impact on the environment are increasing the emergence of infectious diseases (WHO, 2020). In order to reduce the risk of outbreak of new diseases in the future, across the globe we must improve our health systems, improve surveillance of infectious diseases and protect and improve biodiversity and the natural environment (WHO, 2020).</p><p>COVID-19 has had an impact on the environment and the climate. During the early stages of the pandemic and the first national lockdowns, noticeable improvements in air quality were seen in cities across the world. In early April daily global carbon emissions were down 17% on the 2019 value for the same period (Le Quéré et al., 2020). A study in Italy (the first country to impose a national lockdown) found evidence of increases in species richness, increased breeding success of some bird species and reduced road killing of some amphibians and reptiles (Manenti et al., 2020). However, we all know that it is not all good news. The pandemic has caused a surge in<br/>demand for single use plastics and production of huge amounts of medical waste. During the peak of the pandemic in Wuhan China, 247 tonnes of medical waste was produced each day, 6 times more than before the pandemic (<span>Narendra</span> et al., 2020). Across the world, much of the medical waste is incinerated, polluting the atmosphere (Gardiner, 2020). As governments draw up plans to tackle the health<br/>crisis, environmental laws and enforcement of environmental regulations are being put on the back burner (Gardiner, 2020). As a result of illegal logging in the Amazon, 64% more land was cleared in April 2020 than in April 2019 (Reuters, 2020). Across the world, governments are reinforcing the oil and gas industries to shore up economies, and as countries began to emerge from the<br/>first wave of the pandemic industrial activities were ramped up to make up for lost time (Gardiner, 2020). These impacts are ongoing and there is a desperate need for the world to recognise that as we tackle the health crisis, we must emerge greener and change our relationship with the natural world.</p><p>According to an online survey in Scotland, 76% of people agreed that access to green spaces and wildlife were important to their<br/>wellbeing during the first lockdown (WWF, 2020a). During this time many of us enjoyed spending time outdoors and marvelling at the wildlife on our doorsteps. It was a great relief from the uncertainty and stress that the coronavirus was imposing on our lives and provided reassurance that we need not despair. Indeed we are still reaping these benefits from nature. For me a morning walk along<br/>the river to watch the salmon leaping and the otters play and to admire the beautiful fiery colours of the trees and gentle fall of the amber leaves makes my heart smile and gives me a sense of peace and place in this strange new world. Without this I would be lost. We would all be lost.</p><p>To this end we have decided to support WWF with whom<br/>we share the vision of a world where people and wildlife can thrive together. To achieve this mission the WWF are working ‘to find ways to help transform the future for the world’s wildlife, rivers, forests and seas; pushing for a reduction in carbon emissions that will avoid catastrophic climate change; and pressing for measures to help people live sustainably, within the means of our one planet.’ (WWF, 2020b). </p><p>This is entirely optional and we are grateful that you have taken the time to read this.</p><p>Shannon and Molly </p><p><b></b></p><p><b>References</b></p><p><span>Gardiner,<br/>B.
