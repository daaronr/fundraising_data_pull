We decided we wanted to do something positive and helpful with our time during this difficult period, and after some deliberation we decided to set ourselves this tough but worthwhile challenge! The challenge spans one month, beginning 2/11/20 and finishing 2/12/20 - the date lockdown is scheduled to end. The BHF has helped halve the number of people dying from heart and circulatory disease in the UK but sadly every day hundreds of people lose their lives. <span>It is a charity that is very close to my heart, sadly losing my auntie to a heart attack and my dad having suffered a major heart attack several years ago. It was only due to the research of the BHF that he was able to make a full recovery.</span><span>. It's only thanks to support from people like us that the BHF can create new treatments and discover new cures. £24 could pay for two hours of research by an early career scientist, but every pound helps so please give what you can to help us hit our target.

During December hundreds of our fundraising dogs across the UK would usually be out and about wagging their tails and meeting you at supermarket and street collections, Christmas fairs and festive coffee mornings. Our four-legged fundraisers support the 400+ fundraising groups across the UK from Glasgow to Plymouth and everywhere in between.

Due to the current situation, most of our fundraising groups will not be out collecting this festive season, and our four-legged fundraisers will be very much missed! We hope you will do your bit and help us as we aim to raise enough for 12 new guide dog partnerships! Heres how you can join in:

You will have all heard of guide dogs for the Blind but you may not know that our youngest daughter is on the waiting list for a guide dog and this charity along with most charities have been affected by the lockdown. It currently costs around £63,000 to breed train and support a guide dog from birth to retirement, however, the cost of the guide dog is impacted not just by the cost of breeding and training, but also the cost of all the support functions for the partnership over an average of seven years, as well as external support such as food and vets bills. A guide dog owner may have as many as eight guide dogs in their lifetime bringing the total cost to around £500,000.</p><p><span>This is a small gesture towards a huge costs and although it might be a year or two before our daughter Hadley will benefit from this I do hope you will support the essential and amazing  work that Guide Dogs for the Blind does. Thank you..</span></p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure. Your details are safe with JustGiving - they'll never sell them on or send unwanted emails.

I am so proud of our Blakely bear & everything he has faced in his first 5 months. Due to complications and abnormalities in pregnancy Blakely stayed in hospital for additional 5 days post birth and since has had 2 ultrasounds on his stomach, 2 echos on his heart, and is awaiting an MRI under sedation. Throughout this he has been the bravest little boy, always smiling to the nurses & laughing all the way through. I have every faith that he is absolutely fine & he is excelling all of his milestones. This year has been such a strange one, but also the best year yet because you arrived <U+0001F499> You have brought so much light, laughter and love into our lives little bear <U+0001F43B> we love you more than you will ever know! Thank you for always being our happy, smiley little soldier no matter what. Mummy’s best friend always <U+0001F90D> During his stay in hospital Blakely was referred to Great Ormond Street Hospital for cardiology & genetics. Although it was a very brief visit with them (thank god!) they really were amazing and really reassured me that he is okay. It really put things into perspective for me that there are so many other little babies that aren’t as lucky as Blakely and have to spend a lot of their time in hospital with conditions that are a lot more serious than his. Next year we will be taking part in ‘Running off Christmas’ where as a family (Blakely in the buggy of course) we will run/jog/walk 31 miles across January to raise money for GOSH. It would mean the world to me if you could donate a small amount to such an amazing charity<U+0001F49B>","Darby, Josh  Blakely's fundraising page","78","0","411.90","82","0","https://images.justgiving.com/image/52f8663c-9840-439e-9921-217500267067.jpg","https://images.justgiving.com/image/52f8663c-9840-439e-9921-217500267067.jpg?template=size150x150face","31 because Miles","31","Miles",NA,NA,"https://images.justgiving.com/image/9d3747fd-1976-4f5b-af5e-49da2361071e.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true","https://images.justgiving.com/image/9d3747fd-1976-4f5b-af5e-49da2361071e.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"73d345e9-c72b-4dff-b0f6-ebe17ca58037",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Who will grow the most peculiar or weird looking mouser? Will there be mutton chops involved or inspiration taken from a 1980's styled Tom Selleck?</p><p>There is, of course, a serious side to this which is why we are trying to raise a bit money for charity through growing our facial misdemeanours. Movember’s mission is more relevant now than ever. Social isolation has affected the mental health of all of us, including our fathers, partners, brothers, sons and friends. Especially those already finding it hard to stay connected. And its impact will stick around long after the pandemic is over.</p><p>Even starting a conversation about the men’s health crisis is valuable. Not everyone knows that, globally, one man dies by suicide every minute of every day. That nearly 10 million men around the world are living with or beyond prostate cancer. Or that testicular cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in young men.</p><p>Although Movember is mainly aimed at raising awareness of men's health, we both wanted to raise donations for a charity that could be of benefit to everyone in terms of impact of funds we raise. That is why we have chosen Cancer Research UK. We will likely have all been affected by cancer in one way or an other during our lives so the hope is that our fundraising can go some way to helping research into the prevention, diagnosis and development of treatments against all forms of this disease.</p><p>So if you are able to spare a few pennies in support of the 'Tache-off' and helping Cancer Research UK along the way, then Tony &amp; Keir will be incredibly grateful and will make our facial hair growing worth every itchy minute (with photos and results pending!).</p><p>Stay safe everyone.</p><p>Tony &amp; Keir<br/></p>","Tony & Keir's Movember 'Tache-off","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I am a 35yr old mother of 2 beautiful young children, in Devon, UK. </p><p>I recently had ACDF surgery to my spine for a slipped disc at the C6/C7 level. My spinal cord was left damaged, leaving me numb from the stomach down, my left leg immobile and reduced function in my arms and fingers. I then had a spinal fluid leak post-surgery which required another operation to repair it. The doctors estimate I could walk again but it will take time. I am grateful to be alive and that this is no worse. We have been incredibly well looked after and God has proved Himself abundantly faithful. </p><p>I’m going to conservatively estimate the cost of my first surgery alone at £250,000. For one person, one life, in quite drastic circumstances. Meanwhile, every SINGLE day, 800 children die for lack of clean water and soap. It’s so basic and such an easy fix. I would love to try and offset the cost of my surgery by spending the same on sanitation. UNICEF provide soap and clean water access for children in developing countries.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Photo credit: https://bjgp.org/content/bjgp/68/671/296.full.pdf</p>","Helen's Soap for my Spinal","0","0","22.45","0","0","https://images.justgiving.com/image/a32e2dc8-95fb-457a-ab61-19caf2c55348.jpg","https://images.justgiving.com/image/a32e2dc8-95fb-457a-ab61-19caf2c55348.jpg?template=size150x150face","I am raising money because I want every child to have access to sanitation","I am raising money","I want every child to have access to sanitation",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
