Macmillan have given Katherine, Steve and the children support through the very toughest of times, and this is a way to show appreciation for what they have received in their times of need. Here is a charity that endlessly support families in similar situations and they always need help to provide that to everyone that could do with a helping hand. We can’t change the hand we’re dealt, no matter how much we wish we could, but we can show our appreciation for a charity that has helped our loved ones deal with the cruel and relentless blows that cancer throws. So to Steve and Katherine, two perfectly matched people that bring light and laughter to all lucky enough to know them xxx</p><p><span>Thanks for supporting my fundraising.

Then I remembered what I am like and decided to either go big or go home. I intend to go from being melded to my office chair during the pandemic, to doing 5k a day for 30 days. This will coincide almost exactly with my leaving date from NHS Digital (sob!). I can't promise (and don't expect) to run 5k, but I do promise to travel it on foot every day, come rain, shine, hell, highwater and whatever media craziness comes my way. It's my leaving gift to myself. These last few months have been tough and taking care of myself has come way down the list, so I am forcing myself to get some balance before I start my new challenge as Director of Comms at Sherwood Hospitals Trust. I am going to hate myself for this, which is why I am doing it publicly and trying to raise some cash for a great cause.

Every day brings new challenges at Great Ormond

Every day, 618 children and young people
from across the UK arrive. Every day, doctors and
nurses battle the most complex illnesses, and
the brightest minds come together to achieve
pioneering medical breakthroughs.
And every day is a chance for you to make a
difference. This extraordinary hospital has always
depended on charitable support to give seriously
ill children the best chance to fulfil their potential.

Early in the year, the doctors ran out of treatment options and in April he collapsed suddenly. Since then he’s been at home and Andrew and I have been  looking after him along with a fantastic team of carers. We’ve had many  uplifting conversations with him during this time about how much he  enjoyed his childhood, friendships, his time in the army, his career and retirement.</p><p>The ending was as peaceful as we could possibly have hoped for. Andrew and I were both with him, holding his hands, in his own home just as he wanted. The help we’ve had this last week from the carers, St.  Christopher’s Hospice, Marie Curie and the district nurses has been  truly amazing, giving him a dignified, peaceful and painless end that we were worried he wouldn’t have. We've chosen Marie Curie as Dad was already a benefactor of St. Christopher's.<br/></p><p>Over the last few months, Andrew &amp; I have been reflecting on what an outstanding father he has been – the perfect Dad. He adored his seven grandchildren and was immensely proud of them all. His devotion and care for our mother, who has advanced dementia, in recent years is a model of marriage that will remain with us.</p>","A Celebration of the Life of David Blacknell","0","50","0","0","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,"https://images.justgiving.com/image/c602a293-a314-40ea-a4ff-562c3e7a436e.jpg","https://images.justgiving.com/image/c602a293-a314-40ea-a4ff-562c3e7a436e.jpg?template=size150x150face",NA,NA,NA,"814189","David Blacknell","/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/13411999","remember/814189",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our day therapy unit offers outpatient clinics and a wide range of activities and therapies, including baking, art therapy and relaxation. 

We also provide support for carers and families, including our social work team who provide emotional and practical advice. Our chaplain is here to provide spiritual care to patients and their loved ones.

Thank you for supporting us, and helping to make sure more people with a terminal illness in the Newcastle area get the care and support they need.","Hayley 's Christmas 2020","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0a4fcc25-8641-487f-a097-3f643f168e5d",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

With the ongoing pandemic, more people need the Marie Curie than ever before. Their nurses, hospices and Support Line have been here through it all, day and night, caring for dying people with and without coronavirus. Marie Curie Nurses, hospices and bereavement services never stopped working throughout the coronavirus pandemic. It’s vital that funds can continue to be raised for the charity that means so much to so many people.

Without all three, people can’t live dignified, healthy lives. With all three, they can unlock their potential, break free from poverty and change their lives for good.

With clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene, children are born healthier. They get the chance to go to school and grow up to become adults. Women and men get to earn a living. Whole communities start to thrive.
