There are still people fighting their own battles even during Christmas so I need your help to give them a fighting chance of survival and to be able to live the best life they can possibly live.

I will be updating everyone on here as much as I can. Any donations are much appreciated if this is not possible, it's ok but remember to please share this page and help me reach my target. 

For those who have donated thank you so much.

Her wish was for any donations to go to The British heart foundation so for this reason I am setting up this page so anyone that can not attend the funeral has the option to make a donation as a tribute to Kay. </p><p>Kay was an amazingly strong lady and loved by many. It is a heartbreaking loss for all of her family and everyone that knew her so any donation made from the people that knew and loved Kay would be greatly appreciated as it can go towards our own donation to the foundation. </p><p>Thank you for reading </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Thanks for taking the time to visit my JustGiving page.</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.
