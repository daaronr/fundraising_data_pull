The reason why I have chosen Macmillan Cancer is because they helped my family when we didn't have a penny to our name due to my father being diagnosed with cancer and not being able to work. They told us where we could get help and how we could help ourselves, without them I honestly do not know what would have happened. My dad fought cancer for 21 plus years, always with a smile on his face. He is no longer with us in person but is never out of our thoughts and always in our hearts. I totally understand if you can't give in these very challenging times but if you can it would help a great cause and encourage me on my journey from one end of the country to the other. Thank you Alan</p>","Alan's Alan's 50 years on this earth challenge","0","0","0","0","0",NA,"In Memory of Michael O'Brien",NA,"https://images.justgiving.com/image/9b0f6c44-4135-4562-ab3a-07f9fa030ef9.jpg","https://images.justgiving.com/image/9b0f6c44-4135-4562-ab3a-07f9fa030ef9.jpg?template=size150x150face",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"827683","MICHAEL  O'brien","/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/13644841","remember/827683",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

They also know that I love nothing more than to moan about my seemingly never-ending list of injuries. I’ve suffered from hip and back pain for 6 years now following a failed hip arthroscopy surgery back in 2015. <span>I’ve spent the last few years cycling through various doctors, scans and physiotherapists to chase a diagnosis and find the elusive ‘quick fix’ that must be out there. The reality is that as time has passed and I have learnt more about my anatomy, I’ve had to accept that this kind of chronic orthopaedic pain does not always come with simple explanations or fixes. I’ve had multiple diagnoses including mild hip dysplasia, retroverted femur, FAI &amp; facet joint degeneration; all of which contribute to a complex anatomy that essentially pisses off my hips and lower back.</span></p><p>Ultimately, I now manage this pain is through modifying activity and being consistent with physio plans (which anyone that’s done physio will know is a ball-ache at the best of times). This means avoiding or limiting high impact sports like long-distance running, football, squash etc. Whilst this is very frustrating being an active guy in my 20’s, I realise that it could be much worse and that there are plenty of people with way more restricted mobility than me.</p><p><b>So what the hell does this have to do with the Bournemouth Pier to Pier swim? </b>S<span>ince I’ve come to accept (for now) that I can’t go for runs or play high impact sports as much as I’d like to, I’ve been looking for an outlet where my half-assed excuse for a hip can thrive. And I figured that it doesn’t get much more low impact than swimming!</span></p><p>This is probably a good time to mention that one month ago, I could not swim more than 6 lengths front crawl without gasping for breath and wondering why my shoulders were on fire. However my dad persuaded me to book onto a total immersion swimming lesson with an instructor called James Ewart, and it ended up being far more valuable than I envisaged. A few days after the lesson I managed 50 lengths of front crawl (albeit far from perfectly) with controlled breathing and almost no shoulder pain. To celebrate, I did what any sensible person would do after having one successful lesson – and decided to book on to the Bournemouth Pier 2 Pier race. I also decided that instead of suffering through it alone, I would drag my mate Alex down with me.</p><p>So here we are, six months away from our 1.5 mile sea swim, in the middle of a global pandemic and with all the pools shut. Aside from trying to become better swimmers, we're also doing this to raise money for the British Heart Foundation who are more desperate than ever for new funding. The COVID-19 pandemic has cut their ability to fund new research in half, so it would be massively appreciated if you could help make a small but meaningful contribution, in return for us swallowing a gallon of seawater.</p>","Bournemouth Pier to Pier Swim","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,NA,"https://images.justgiving.com/image/b6994332-9aa7-42b8-b75c-9197ef32b999.jpg","https://images.justgiving.com/image/b6994332-9aa7-42b8-b75c-9197ef32b999.jpg?template=size150x150face","true","true",NA,NA,"Alex Sherman",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This has caused me visual impairment and could’ve led to more serious impairments if it had gone untreated. The surgery consisted of my head being cut open from my left ear, over the top of my head and down to my right ear. Parts of my skull were then cut away and repositioned. I still have pieces of metal in my head to help hold my skull together. I had a bandage around my head like a helmet to protect my head and the swelling. I was in intensive care for 3 days monitoring blood loss. After coming out of ICU I was in hospital for a few weeks but recovered well under great Ormond streets care with routine appointments until I was 13. I’ve got a massive scar on my head, and hair permanently missing but I love it. It shows the journey I’ve been on and how far I’ve come! So this January I will be taking part in Running off Christmas. I will be running 31 miles in 31 days, to raise money to give back to Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH). Without Great Ormond Street Hospital, I genuinely wouldn’t be the person I am today. Knowing how much they’ve helped me and knowing that there are so many more children in need of the same help, most of those with conditions far worse than mine. It would mean a great deal to me if you could help me help them.","Lili-Mae Giving Something Back to GOSH","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,"73d345e9-c72b-4dff-b0f6-ebe17ca58037",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

With the money that is raised for the charity, Leon and I was able to stay really close to the hospital where Oliver was being treated. It costs around £900 a month to keep a family in accommodation by the hospital in the centre of London. In total we have been there nearly 6 months over the 5 years of Oliver’s life. So we would be so grateful if you guys can support us in donating a little something to help us reach our target for this fantastic hospital. Without them, we wouldn’t be where we are today &#128591;</p><p><br/></p><p>Our story...</p><p>We found out about Oliver’s heart condition (tetralogy of fallot) at my 20 week scan which shook our world to say the least! It was a week before Christmas in 2013. We was transferred to the John Radcliffe in Oxford the next day for a more in depth heart scan. We were given lots of information that evening and choices including the worst case which is every parents nightmare. Then at 22 weeks my waters broke and our world was thrown up side down. Fortunately, Oliver held on with limited waters and was born 6 weeks later at the John Radcliffe by an emergency C section, where he was kicking and screaming which we then knew we had a fighter on our hands. Oliver was really poorly and it was touch and go for which seemed like a life time. Then at 4 weeks old (32 weeks gestation) he was transferred to GOSH. He was the smallest baby on CICU at 1.2kg. Few days later on the Saturday morning, he had 2 cardiac arrests, the second he was gone for 6 mins (our world crumbled but we had all our faith in the team). Once again he came back fighting and on the Tuesday morning he had his life saving operation (there was no other choice which either we turned off his life support or go a head with the operation). He was the smallest baby worldwide to have a stent procedure through his tiny leg artery to his heart at 1.2kg!</p><p>Fast forward nearly 5 years where Oliver has undergone 4 more stent procedures, 2 open heart surgery’s and Oliver has just recovered from his 3rd open heart op nearly 6 weeks ago where they did a valve replacement. We owe everything to the team at GOSH to allow us to have Christmas at home as a family. </p><p>Thank you for reading and any donation would be so grateful to us all xx</p><p><br/></p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

After 20+ years of talking about it and a last minute gin fuelled application, I got accepted to do my Primary PGDE. Then it just went downhill from there. <br/><br/>Covid hit, home learning, Google Classroom and working at the education hub became the norm and life just took on a slower pace. We enjoyed family walks, baking and just spending time together. Schools went back, I started uni and life seemed to be slowly getting back to &#34;normal&#34;. <br/><br/>September came, Aberdeen went into lockdown again and my life turned upside down. Overnight my days became hospital visits and phone calls and Mum became my number one priority. I quickly realised uni would need to wait and deferred to restart next year, looking after Mum was my job now. Sadly things didn't go as planned and Mum didn't get to spend the time at home with family and friends that she had wanted. What Mum and I did get though was one last outing along Stonehaven beach in the sunshine, something so simple but a memory that I will treasure forever. The next few months were a rollercoaster as I watched my wonderful Mum slowly get taken from us, along with a wee health scare of my own thrown in for good measure. The year was not done with me though and a week after my amazing Mum passed away, Covid entered our house and isolation started. The timing was beyond cruel, snatching away our final chance to say goodbye to our loving Mum, Granny and Mother-In-Law &#128148;<br/><br/>So well done 2020, you broke me but you also showed me I am stronger than I ever thought I could be. As I go in to 2021, I am leaving behind the &#128169; and moving forward with treasured memories and the reminder that I have the most amazing friends and family around me. Thank you to all of you who have helped me through the last few months with advice, loaning of equipment, food parcels, uni notes, baking, flowers, gifts, messages, phone calls, video calls and doorstep visits. Most of all though thank you to Eddy and my girls, who have been amazing <U+2764> I look forward to making lots more happy memories with you all in 2021 &#129392;<br/><br/>If any of you would like to finish this horrible year on a positive note, I have set up a donation page to Cancer Research in the hope that their research can help stop another family go through the cruel pain of cancer. <br/><br/>Thank you again &amp; a happy new year to all of you &#127881; Hold your loved ones close, live every day as if it's your last and may your 2021 be a happy and healthy one &#128536;<!--/data/user/0/com.samsung.android.app.notes/files/clipdata/clipdata_201231_104028_772.sdoc--><br/></p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

Be kind! <br/><br/>I know the charities and science research is going to take a huge hit this year and we can see what happens when money and scientists get together.

On top of everything COVID, she now had to face this horrific disease in the midst of the pandemic. This required her to endure chemotherapy followed by surgery followed by radiotherapy.
