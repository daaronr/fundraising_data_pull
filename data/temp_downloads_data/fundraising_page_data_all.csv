In fact, until recently, if you’d of asked me I would have told you that running altogether should be illegal.  However, I have been persuaded, by Macmillan, by what the Charity means to the people around me. By the affects of Cancer and the need for such an amazing charity to be regularly available to those that need it. SO, I have started the Couch to 5k, then I shall do 5-10k and 10-20k until I can run without crying and/or vomiting. I will stand by my friends and hope adrenaline and good-will carry my skinny legs through!</p><p>Although Macmillan didn’t get the opportunity to physically support my (Dumpsy) in his late diagnosis of bowel cancer  they were a massive ray of hope for me and my Nana recently in his last days. Their support and understanding was a well needed sense of calm and rational in a hard and confusing time. </p><p>Even now, the Macmillan team still contribute to affect the lives of those I love.<span> I can’t pretend to relate to some of the ways that Cancer has touched some of those closest to me. </span><span>However, running this Half Marathon, raising donations for Macmillan, is a way for me to support those that my words cannot. I can’t cure cancer! But </span><span>I CAN put on a wig and run at the back of 100,000 other people wanting to support people that need it. Please donate if you can afford to! If not please share!

Our partnership focuses on tackling financial hardship and loneliness together, helping Macmillan develop their telephone, online and virtual support services and to help thousands more people with much needed financial and emotional support.

The CBRE partnership is going to be more important than ever before, to help Macmillan do whatever it takes to support every single person living with cancer.

In our 40th year in the UK we are calling on the support of our employees, their families and our partners to help this wonderful charity who offered unwavering support to a valued employee and friend of GEFCO UK, Denise Panter, and her family during her fight against cancer last year. The past 12 months have been extremely challenging for all and the pandemic has placed restrictions upon what we can do to acknowledge our time in the UK. So, we’d like to brighten up our summer and celebrate this milestone by raising much needed funds for our chosen charity partner and invest further in our employee’s wellbeing by encouraging as many who are willing, to walk the distance with us.</p><p><br/></p><p>My story - </p><p>So as some of you will be aware, in 2020 I faced my own battle with cancer. In September I was diagnosed with testicular cancer and although I seen myself as relatively fit and healthy, with age on my side, I was still left with the worry of wondering how bad it was and what treatment etc I would need. It was then I had the realisation that it can literally happen to any of us and it’s sad that most of us now, know someone who has or has had cancer. Now I was really lucky that mine was found early and after being removed, I only had to go through one count of chemotherapy and touch wood I am now fine, with just regular check ups for the next few years. </p><p><span>I said in 2021 I would like to raise as much money as possible to help support the cause and COVID dependant, I have a few things I would like to do this year. The first one is taking part in a 40 mile walk on the weekend of the 9th July.</span></p><p><span>I would appreciate any donations you can kindly offer. I know lots of you have supported me in charity events before and lots of us are busy supporting charities all the time, but no donation is too small and a massive help to a great cause. </span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>Thanks in advance </span></p>","cdb0141b-ffce-48e9-8a1a-f578bf2fd6fc","GEFCO2021","Aaron’s page","8.75","0","50","20","0","true",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our partnership focuses on tackling financial hardship and loneliness together, helping Macmillan develop their telephone, online and virtual support services and to help thousands more people with much needed financial and emotional support.

The CBRE partnership is going to be more important than ever before, to help Macmillan do whatever it takes to support every single person living with cancer.

Living with cancer can be devastating at the best of times, but even harder as a result of the recent pandemic.  At Macmillan, we talk to people affected by cancer every day and for many, issues with money and mental health such as stress and depression, are their biggest worry.

Our partnership focuses on tackling financial hardship and loneliness together, helping Macmillan develop their telephone, online and virtual support services and to help thousands more people with much needed financial and emotional support.

The CBRE partnership is going to be more important than ever before, to help Macmillan do whatever it takes to support every single person living with cancer.

Cancer is not going anywhere.  And neither can Macmillan.

Thank you!</p><p>I’m raising money for MacMillan Cancer Support as my grandad passed away on 16th March 2021 and their support in the run up to his final days on this earth was phenomenal. I don’t know whether my grandparents just got lucky with the amazing MacMillan nurse, Tracey or if they’re all so wonderful but she truly was a light in the darkest of times and made sure that my grandads final hours were the most comfortable and supported he could possibly have.</p><p>My grandad was all about helping others wherever he could. Nothing was too much effort and he always made sure his family was safe, supported and we always came first no matter what. To say he was one of a kind is an understatement and the hurt we feel from his loss is indescribable.</p><p>There were a number of charities that I wanted to do this for including Marie Curie, Barnsley Hospice and Prostate Cancer UK but Tracey from MacMillan really did show us that star quality when it came to genuine care and love for her patients and families. I think my grandad would agree that this was the right choice.</p><p>There’s no confirmed date yet but my Skydive will be taking place towards the end of May so I’ve got two months to raise my goal of £500 - I considered doing some walking or jogging around but hey, that just isn’t my style! I wanted to bring some excitement and craziness to the cause and give people something to REALLY donate for!</p><p>A little goes a long way in helping me reach my target so I honestly do appreciate every penny donated. I couldn’t just sit around waiting for the grief to pass, I wanted to do something to continue making my grandad proud.

Cancer seems to affect us all in some way and as any person with cancer knows, a cancer diagnosis also affects family members and friends. Sometimes, the complex feelings and lifestyle changes caused by cancer and its treatment become as overwhelming for others as they are for the person affected. This is why Macmillan Cancer Support workers are so important. They consist of millions of people affected by cancer, supporters, professionals, volunteers, and campaigners and they all have one thing in common  their care and support for people living with cancer. So we at TBG will make the daunting 24,901 miles to support Macmillan  how far will you go?

They play a big role in the NHS which is very critical in todays current climate. By supporting them you are helping this service and could save many lives.<br/></p><p>I have challenged myself to a 30 mile route which requires me to go down huge drops and up monstrous climbs accumulating 3,000 feet of climbing across the cotswolds. This is a real challenge as I am not an experienced rider - I am a goalkeeper and so the extent of my fitness requires me to dive from one goal post to another!</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure. Your details are safe with JustGiving - they'll never sell them on or send unwanted emails. Once you donate, they'll send your money directly to the charity.

In 2020 I had booked to ‘up the challenge level’ and was all set to complete both Glasgow and Edinburgh half marathons on consecutive weekends. Unfortunately due to current worldly circumstances, these events were cancelled. </p><p>Cue a change of plans!! </p><p>Taking things up a notch again, beginning in June 2020, I decided to run a half marathon every month for a year. Bearing in mind I would usually have to put in some considerable run training before such a one off event, this new challenge meant I would need to keep up this level of grit and discipline for a full year. The winter months especially worrying me due to health conditions in my hands and arms which are heightened with the cold. Still.... the goal was to push through; a challenge is not a challenge without pushing yourself. </p><p>As someone who could not run the length of herself and had little to no self belief not all that long ago,  I am very proud of my progress in my own health and fitness to date - physically and mentally. If I can inspire just one other person to have the belief in them self that they can feel better, then I’d be very happy. </p><p>I'm raising money for the British Heart Foundation and I'd be so grateful for your support. This charity means a lot personally to me and my family. They have helped halve the number of people dying from heart and circulatory disease in the UK but sadly every day hundreds of people still lose their lives. </p><p>Every pound helps towards creating new treatments and discovering new cures, so please give what you can to help me hit my target.

During this time I personally have found their information services incredibly helpful and I have also used their Cardiac Nurse Phone line whom I have found most knowledgeable. During lockdown I have also re-visited their DVD for Cardiac Rehab which has been most beneficial. </p><p>This year BHF are celebrating 60 years of life saving research. My understanding is that in cases like mine (ie I had my SCA in Mile 25 of a Trail Marathon and had CPR administered by fellow runners, and a recent study in Warwick showed that about 5 in a 100 people who have an OOH SCA arrive at Hospital alive and of those many will struggle to make it out of Hospital without some issues as the brain will have been starved of oxygen whilst &#34;down&#34; (ie unconscious) . About 50% die as there are no bystanders and many of the others as the bystanders don't know what to do. Hence I went along to a series of CPR Training sessions with BHF &amp; BBC Radio Suffolk to say you can save a life by knowing how to do CPR. My blog of my journey has been reproduced in Paul Swindell's book, Life after Sudden Cardiac Arrest. I will re-tell sections on facebook for those interested.</p><p>As we gradually ease out of lockdown, and begin to enjoy some Spring sunshine, this is the perfect time to focus on improving our health and wellbeing.   The British Heart Foundation turns 60 this year and we wanted to mark the occasion.  With support from Active Suffolk, we want to encourage as many people in Suffolk to take on a ‘60’ themed challenge.    For some, it could be completing 60 miles (100K) during the month of April (30 days) which is equates to roughly 2miles/3K per day.   For others, it could be committing to 60 minutes of relaxation every day, or undertaking 60 minutes of gentle activity, or 60 minutes of gardening.   Whatever your ‘60’ challenge is, we want you to feel part of a community who can encourage, inspire and support one another.</p>","46ad8fc6-4542-47e6-815e-71ddca9b61a3","suffolk60","Suffolk60 Challenge.","5","0","20","33","0","true","I am doing the Suffolk60 because I want to support them following my SCA 3 years ag","I am doing the Suffolk60","I want to support them following my SCA 3 years ag",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I’m raising money for the British Heart Foundation and would be very grateful for your support. <br/>Our journey began over 15 years ago when my father in law Gus had his first heart attack age 67. <br/>He had to retire from an active working life in forestry, now on medication and leading a more sedentary life, but every day was a blessing for us all. <br/><br/>Over the next 14 years, there were a few smaller heart attacks but he recovered with medication and determination and enough to keep his hand in on the occasional woodworking project. <br/><br/>September 2020 Gus took a turn for the worst. His failing heart unable to function well enough and fluid was building up almost ‘drowning him from the inside out’<br/>The family were called as his heart went into uncontrollable tachycardia which meant it could have given up at any moment. <br/>He was treated in hospital over the next month but due to covid restrictions only Violet, my mother in law was allowed to visit. <br/>The separation from home and his family was taking it’s toll on Gus. <br/><br/>Finally he was stabilised enough to be discharged back home to the care of his family as no further treatment would be successful. <br/><br/>As we knew we were on borrowed time we formed a ‘Macdonald bubble’ forsaking allowable interactions with other family &amp; friends to enable we kept Gus safe. This sacrifice allowed us to spend as much time enjoying, loving and caring for him and supporting Vi who had taken on the role as his full time carer. <br/><br/>Gus &amp; Vi had been married 58 years.

I unfortunately found out the hard way that I have a congenital heart disease issue. Following a procedure I'm back to somewhere near normal but the past few months have been a real wake up call for me. The care and support I have received has been brilliant and the work performed by the BHF has had a direct impact on that, so in the very least this is an opportunity to give something back. To mark the 60th birthday of the BHF, on April 25th I will be cycling 60 miles around Suffolk and am looking for sponsorship. A number of people will be joining me for various distances to keep me going including Callum, Kevin, Bob, Grahame, Jared and Shane. We also have arranged a great support crew. Anything you can do to support this cause will be gratefully received. Thankyou. </p><p>As we gradually ease out of lockdown, and begin to enjoy some Spring sunshine, this is the perfect time to focus on improving our health and wellbeing.   The British Heart Foundation turns 60 this year and we wanted to mark the occasion.  With support from Active Suffolk, we want to encourage as many people in Suffolk to take on a ‘60’ themed challenge.    For some, it could be completing 60 miles (100K) during the month of April (30 days) which is equates to roughly 2miles/3K per day.   For others, it could be committing to 60 minutes of relaxation every day, or undertaking 60 minutes of gentle activity, or 60 minutes of gardening.   Whatever your ‘60’ challenge is, we want you to feel part of a community who can encourage, inspire and support one another. </p>","46ad8fc6-4542-47e6-815e-71ddca9b61a3","suffolk60","SaddleSore60","73.75","0","345","69","0","true",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Guide Dogs remains committed to supporting people with sight loss across the UK. It has never been more important to come together online and support one another.

As you know I got Flynn in November of last year and I cant explain how much he has changed my life. It’s not just the practical/obvious things he has helped with like walking to school, walking at night, shopping and the list could go on. He has also helped me walk around the shops with a little less anxiety, a little less embarrassed about myself and I now am learning to walk with my head held high because of him. I also had the BEST couch I could of ever asked for, so this fundraising isn’t just for the dogs its also for the trainers who put their time into these incredible dogs, its for the boarders that open there homes to the dogs. So please, I know I have asked you before but I need your help again. I am planning to do 10,000 steps with Flynn and raise as much as possible. Thank you for taking your time to read this story. This is just the beginning for me and Flynn. </p><p><span> Just £95 could buy a training school kit for one guide dog trainer who will teach pups the special skills they need as fully qualified guide dog.

Your small steps will help Guide Dogs make giant leaps. Just one week of stepping can make a difference to the life of children and adults living with sight loss. Raise over £50 (£25 for children) and well replace those worn out socks with a brand-new Guide Dogs pair designed by an international fashion icon!

How your funds will change lives...

-	£50 could pay for fun, tactile activities to help children co-ordinate their muscles and movements.

-	£96 could pay for an eye test each for two guide dogs in training

-	£116 could buy a Training School Kit for one of our guide dog trainers who will teach pups the specialist skills they need as fully qualified guide dogs.

-	£710 could buy a Birthing Kit containing all the essential equipment for a guide dog mum to safely deliver her puppies.

Its thanks to people like you that we can continue to provide life-changing services. So, a huge thank you and lots of luck for your challenge!

Your small steps will help Guide Dogs make giant leaps. Just one week of stepping can make a difference to the life of children and adults living with sight loss. Raise over £50 (£25 for children) and well replace those worn out socks with a brand-new Guide Dogs pair designed by an international fashion icon!

How your funds will change lives...

-	£50 could pay for fun, tactile activities to help children co-ordinate their muscles and movements.

-	£96 could pay for an eye test each for two guide dogs in training

-	£116 could buy a Training School Kit for one of our guide dog trainers who will teach pups the specialist skills they need as fully qualified guide dogs.

-	£710 could buy a Birthing Kit containing all the essential equipment for a guide dog mum to safely deliver her puppies.

Your small steps will help Guide Dogs make giant leaps. Just one week of stepping can make a difference to the life of children and adults living with sight loss. Raise over £50 (£25 for children) and well replace those worn out socks with a brand-new Guide Dogs pair designed by an international fashion icon!

How your funds will change lives...

-	£50 could pay for fun, tactile activities to help children co-ordinate their muscles and movements.

-	£96 could pay for an eye test each for two guide dogs in training

-	£116 could buy a Training School Kit for one of our guide dog trainers who will teach pups the specialist skills they need as fully qualified guide dogs.

-	£710 could buy a Birthing Kit containing all the essential equipment for a guide dog mum to safely deliver her puppies.

Your small steps will help Guide Dogs make giant leaps. Just one week of stepping can make a difference to the life of children and adults living with sight loss. Raise over £50 (£25 for children) and well replace those worn out socks with a brand-new Guide Dogs pair designed by an international fashion icon!

How your funds will change lives...

-	£50 could pay for fun, tactile activities to help children co-ordinate their muscles and movements.

-	£96 could pay for an eye test each for two guide dogs in training

-	£116 could buy a Training School Kit for one of our guide dog trainers who will teach pups the specialist skills they need as fully qualified guide dogs.

-	£710 could buy a Birthing Kit containing all the essential equipment for a guide dog mum to safely deliver her puppies.

Your small steps will help Guide Dogs make giant leaps. Just one week of stepping can make a difference to the life of children and adults living with sight loss. Raise over £50 (£25 for children) and well replace those worn out socks with a brand-new Guide Dogs pair designed by an international fashion icon!

How your funds will change lives...

-	£50 could pay for fun, tactile activities to help children co-ordinate their muscles and movements.

-	£96 could pay for an eye test each for two guide dogs in training

-	£116 could buy a Training School Kit for one of our guide dog trainers who will teach pups the specialist skills they need as fully qualified guide dogs.

-	£710 could buy a Birthing Kit containing all the essential equipment for a guide dog mum to safely deliver her puppies.

Your small steps will help Guide Dogs make giant leaps. Just one week of stepping can make a difference to the life of children and adults living with sight loss. Raise over £50 (£25 for children) and well replace those worn out socks with a brand-new Guide Dogs pair designed by an international fashion icon!

How your funds will change lives...

-	£50 could pay for fun, tactile activities to help children co-ordinate their muscles and movements.

-	£96 could pay for an eye test each for two guide dogs in training

-	£116 could buy a Training School Kit for one of our guide dog trainers who will teach pups the specialist skills they need as fully qualified guide dogs.

-	£710 could buy a Birthing Kit containing all the essential equipment for a guide dog mum to safely deliver her puppies.

Your small steps will help Guide Dogs make giant leaps. Just one week of stepping can make a difference to the life of children and adults living with sight loss. Raise over £50 (£25 for children) and well replace those worn out socks with a brand-new Guide Dogs pair designed by an international fashion icon!

How your funds will change lives...

-	£50 could pay for fun, tactile activities to help children co-ordinate their muscles and movements.

-	£96 could pay for an eye test each for two guide dogs in training

-	£116 could buy a Training School Kit for one of our guide dog trainers who will teach pups the specialist skills they need as fully qualified guide dogs.

-	£710 could buy a Birthing Kit containing all the essential equipment for a guide dog mum to safely deliver her puppies.

Your small steps will help Guide Dogs make giant leaps. Just one week of stepping can make a difference to the life of children and adults living with sight loss. Raise over £50 (£25 for children) and well replace those worn out socks with a brand-new Guide Dogs pair designed by an international fashion icon!

How your funds will change lives...

-	£50 could pay for fun, tactile activities to help children co-ordinate their muscles and movements.

-	£96 could pay for an eye test each for two guide dogs in training

-	£116 could buy a Training School Kit for one of our guide dog trainers who will teach pups the specialist skills they need as fully qualified guide dogs.

-	£710 could buy a Birthing Kit containing all the essential equipment for a guide dog mum to safely deliver her puppies.

Your small steps will help Guide Dogs make giant leaps. Just one week of stepping can make a difference to the life of children and adults living with sight loss. Raise over £50 (£25 for children) and well replace those worn out socks with a brand-new Guide Dogs pair designed by an international fashion icon!

How your funds will change lives...

-	£50 could pay for fun, tactile activities to help children co-ordinate their muscles and movements.

-	£96 could pay for an eye test each for two guide dogs in training

-	£116 could buy a Training School Kit for one of our guide dog trainers who will teach pups the specialist skills they need as fully qualified guide dogs.

-	£710 could buy a Birthing Kit containing all the essential equipment for a guide dog mum to safely deliver her puppies.

They need us now, more than ever. 

For any parent, it is a worrying time when your child needs hospital treatment. But if your child is seriously ill, in the middle of a pandemic, this is even more daunting. 

With infection control restrictions on parents staying with their children, worry around travelling safely to and from hospital and being treated by staff in protective clothing, what is already a stressful time is even more challenging.

They need us now, more than ever. 

For any parent, it is a worrying time when your child needs hospital treatment. But if your child is seriously ill, in the middle of a pandemic, this is even more daunting. 

With infection control restrictions on parents staying with their children, worry around travelling safely to and from hospital and being treated by staff in protective clothing, what is already a stressful time is even more challenging.

Your support could help fund services like the hospitals incredible Play team, Social Work Service and multi-faith chaplaincy team, as well as funding family accommodation so mums and dads stay near their children.

They need us now, more than ever. 

For any parent, it is a worrying time when your child needs hospital treatment. But if your child is seriously ill, in the middle of a pandemic, this is even more daunting. 

With infection control restrictions on parents staying with their children, worry around travelling safely to and from hospital and being treated by staff in protective clothing, what is already a stressful time is even more challenging.

Your support could help fund services like the hospitals incredible Play team, Social Work Service and multi-faith chaplaincy team, as well as funding family accommodation so mums and dads stay near their children.

It'll also keep me going and give me the power-up I need to complete this challenge. Its quick, easy and secure to donate, just press the give now button on the right. Thanks!

The Hospice is often very different from what people expect  it is a warm, friendly space with beautiful gardens, delicious home-cooked food and personalised care. Every person is treated as an individual and helped to reach their goals and fulfil their wishes. A team of nurses, doctors, social workers, physiotherapists, chaplains, bereavement counsellors and pharmacists work together, putting every person at the centre of their care.

Throughout Covid-19 Glasgow Hospice teams have been working around the clock to continue supporting local people. Death, dying and bereavement is at the forefront of peoples minds and Marie Curie knows what a difference the right care at the end of life can make.

They cant do any of this without your support. Thank you for your generous donation which supports the Glasgow Hospice and Marie Curie across the UK.

Time is a healer apparently, but it never really gets easier. I find myself thinking about her often, and sometimes those memories are so special thinking about all the fun times. Then there's the ones that make you feel like you've been slapped in the face and you actually cannot believe life can be so cruel. 12 years without her in our lives and I've decided I want to do something in her memory. I want to raise money for Marie Curie Newcastle so that others can be supported and looked after like Mam was. She wasn't at Marie Curie for long, but I still remember the care she received when she was so ill.</p><p><b><u>SO</u></b> I have decided to get my long mop cut off. Not shaved as my Sis will kill me for being a bald bridesmaid, but a very short style. It's taken me 4 years to get my hair this length, so it's a big step for me. If you are able to support and sponsor me it would be very much appreciated. I will also be donating my actual hair to the Little Princess Trust.</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

We believe that not only people living in wealthy countries deserve health care, especially during a pandemic and we should do our best to make a difference and help people that might be struggling. So please if you have anything to spare please donate because even a small amount will make a huge difference. Just £30 could provide a full kit to protect a health-worker on the frontline, including gloves, masks and coveralls, while just £43 could help provide 1,680 pairs of disposable gloves for health workers.The impact of a large-scale outbreak of coronavirus on children, especially poor and vulnerable children, has been immense. Children are at risk from the disease, but also from the disruption to health and education services, impacts on caregivers, and separation from family members.Unicef has been working closely with governments and the World Health Organization (WHO) since the start of the coronavirus outbreak and will continue to do so with help from donations. All donations  made to our page will help to limit the spread of the virus and reduce the impact on children and families.</span><br/></p>",NA,NA,"Our page to help those in other countries access Coronavirus vaccines","0","0","0","0","0","true","We are walking a marathon on Easter Saturday because we want all countries to be vaccinated","We are walking a marathon on Easter Saturday","we want all countries to be vaccinated",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"e9875991-4b88-4d36-8388-60e0d3aeb80d",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

From 15th February, well be walking, running, cycling, rowing and swimming to travel the 5,777 miles between Manchester to Madagascar, all in aid of highlighting WaterAid's work in Antenanarivo, Madagascar.

5,777 miles might take us a while to complete, so we are going to compete in two teams and start at each end - one team in Manchester and one team in Madagascar - and the objective is to meet in the middle by Easter, and see who gets there first!

Well be walking, running, cycling, rowing or even swimming (when allowed!) to help contribute individually and virtually to the 5,777 miles we need to complete together. 

The objective is to improve all our wellbeing, get us all out more in the fresh air and away from our computers, and to raise £5,777 for a truly magnificent cause!
