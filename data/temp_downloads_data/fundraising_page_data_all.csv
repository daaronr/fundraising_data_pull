It has been a complete rollercoaster  since that day and 7years later she is thankfully she is still here. She sacrifices ALOT to be able to fight cancer. Some days are just plain crap and unfair and then she has good times. But none of this she could do without the amazing efforts within the field of oncology. The support she receives from the wider cancer community I know is a massive help to her. This is why I want to give something back.

This should have been our 3rd, but 2020 had its own problems. We surpassed our target in 2019 although it didn't all go through JustGiving. We'd like to reach £2,500 this year, so please help with a donation of as little or as much as you like.<br/></p><p>We only had one problem in 2019 and that was a puncture which was not as easily fixed as you might imagine, (our jack didn't fit properly!) So we're using the same car that you can see in the picture above - Volvo 850 Estate. I am making a few modifications to it though due to the 'slightly' more adverse conditions we will face. Eg. The stickers all need changing and the aircon doesn't work!<br/></p><p>We'll be travelling from Edinburgh down and across to Ireland, (I said the conditions would be worse!), then back again and down to Portsmouth where we cross to Spain. From there due south and over to Morocco and the Sahara! We hope to complete it, but I think our car is the cheapest - and the most expensive was just £500....<br/></p><p>We will carry our own spares, tools, etc, (including 4 spare wheels) - what we'd like is donations so that on completion we can pass as much as possible to Guide Dogs. <br/></p><p>Please help us to help.</p><p>I've had a few people donate cash personally which is fine as &#34;Guide Dogs&#34; have given me the correct paperwork. Every little helps! Many thanks to all contributers. <br/></p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure. All <br/>donations go directly to the charity and don't have to wait until I post<br/>them in.<br/></p><p>The sponsorship money you help us raise will truly make a difference. £140 could buy a Starter Kit for a new guide dog owner, containing everything they need to start a life with their new guide dog, this includes the iconic white harness. It's thanks to people like you that Guide Dogs can continue to provide life-changing services, like their guide dogs, to people with sight loss. So, a huge thank you for your support.</p><p><br/></p>","Rust 2 Sahara!

They rely on the safest, most reliable lifeboats and modern stations to launch from. From the stunning Dorset, Sussex and Kent coastlines to the unpredictable tidal Thames, our favourite places in the South east are enjoyed by millions of people from across the country every year. But the water remains an unpredictable environment that can catch people out. People will always need our help and we will always be there to answer that call.Keeping a modern fleet of lifeboats maintained, fuelled and ever ready to go to the rescue from all 31 South East lifeboat stations is expensive and we rely entirely on voluntary donations to ensure this service is maintained. </p><p><span>This is why I will be taking on an enormous mental challenge and be running 1 mile on the hour every hour for 24 hours. To make it a marathon distance I will run 2 miles for the first 2 hours making this challenge even harder!!  This challenge will not only be physically hard but also mentally, requiring me to stay awake for the majority 24 hours and running at all hours of the day. The fact that I will be running at every hour of the day will represent the fact that the RNLI volunteers will drop everything at any time of day to help those in need. I would really appreciate if you could donate even a couple of quid and if not I would really appreciate it if you shared this fundraising page so I can raise as much as possible for an amazing cause. Thank you so much for any help and I will post updates on this page regularly.</span></p><p><span>You can also follow my challenge on my Instagram @all_the_stations and my Strava, my name being Charlie Griffith and the profile picture being of a Marmot.</span></p>","A Mile an Hour","6.50","0","36","14","0","true",NA,NA,NA,NA,"https://images.justgiving.com/image/7eb7c024-b495-4985-97d1-a149a5402aa1.jpg","https://images.justgiving.com/image/7eb7c024-b495-4985-97d1-a149a5402aa1.jpg?template=size150x150face",NA,"4f75faf9-af02-40e4-9ed9-fa3204429271",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

She has therefore decided, to walk to see them - or at least walk the distance from her house in Oxfordshire to their homes. She will first visit her granny in Hampshire and, after brief stops with her uncles and aunt, she will end her walk at her grandparents' house in London. She should cover 85.3 miles. She hopes to complete this distance by 31 March - the date after which she is hoping she will be able to see them all in person again. She will need to walk about one lap of the village each day to complete this.  </p><p><span>Thanks for taking the time to visit my JustGiving page.</span><br/></p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.
