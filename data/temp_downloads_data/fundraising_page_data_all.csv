Both our family and my Mum were very grateful for their endless kindness and support. My Mum was so sad to leave them when she was moved to Kirkcaldy Hospice. We are also eternally grateful for all of the incredible staff at the hospice and will be looking to do a separate fundraiser later in the year as a thank you to them as well.

My dad always talked about going to Twickenham to watch an England v Scotland match, he never achieved that dream.</p><p>As a fundraiser and in honour of my dad Tom Thomson, I have decided to virtually cycle from our home in Ayr to Twickenham, a total of 710.1km or 441.2 miles.This means I will be required to cycle 32 km or 20 miles each day and my aim is to arrive no later than 1600hrs on Saturday 6th February the day after I turn 16.  </p><p>This fundraiser is for BHF Scotland, Wellington School Ayr and most of all my much loved dad TOM. All donations will be gratefully received, along with your support to keep me going over the next 3 weeks. Thank you for visiting my page,</p><p> Katie Thomson X</p><p></p>",NA,NA,"Katie's Virtual Cycle to Twickenham","221.25","0","1180.57","59","0","true",NA,NA,"833067","Tom Thomson","/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/13696888","remember/833067","https://images.justgiving.com/image/b40568b6-ebc6-4668-bb0d-660a0a9021d8.png?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true","https://images.justgiving.com/image/b40568b6-ebc6-4668-bb0d-660a0a9021d8.png?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For those that have known me for many years, you know this isn’t the first time I’ve raised money for charity. Back In 2013 and 2014 I raised money for children charities by trekking the Great Wall of China and then running the London Marathon. I raised a lot of money around £7000 in total but when I saw this challenge on Facebook I thought this is for me. </p><p><span>I’ve trained to walk 10 days in China , I’ve trained to complete 26.2 miles running without stopping and I’ve swum the equivalent of the channel to France but the thought of not been able to eat chocolate for 31 days seems like the impossible for me. I’d happily walk 10,000 steps a day , give up alcohol for a year and maybe just maybe train for a 10k but really no chocolate for a whole 31 days ???? </span></p><p><span>For those that truly know me ,they know I am a chocoholic. They know that during a night shift I will call at the 24hr garage and buy bags of share bag chocolates and just sit and eat the lot to myself, how I will never just eat a normal amount of chocolate recommended in one sitting , how I find it acceptable to sit and eat a whole tub of celebrations in one go. I am never that far away from the sweet stuff. The truth is I am a chocoholic and there isn’t a day that goes by where I don’t feed my addiction. </span></p><p><span>So please believe me when I say , I think signing up for this challenge and doing a whole 31 days will be that ... a true challenge. I recently downloaded an app to help with my addiction and so far I’ve managed a total streak for 4 days and that’s me trying. </span></p><p><span>So please sponsor me to complete what I believe will be the biggest challenge I’ve ever signed up for . Knowing you are supporting me by donating your well earned cash is what will keep me going , knowing we are raising money for the British Heart Foundation and all the people they help.  </span></p><p><span>Thank you ! Please follow me during the month of March on my socials to see how I get on. </span></p><p><span>Please see below a few words from the charity - </span></p><p><span>The pandemic is the biggest challenge we've faced in our 60 year history. And it's led to us being forced to make the devastating decision to cut our 2020 research budget in half. So the truth is, we've never needed people like you more.

He received open heart surgery in 2018 to replace his own failing valve. He recovered from this surgery, however later on in the following year he developed an infection in the replacement valve. After months of suffering and failed treatments he was given one last chance of recovery in the form of open heart surgery to remove the infection around the valve. He was given a 50/50 chance of surviving the surgery. During this surgery they also replaced the valve. He survived the surgery, however he returned following it in a critical condition and died 2 days later.</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>Due to Covid restrictions we were unable to be with my father when he needed us the most. To our heartache and devastation, my father had to endure the most terrifying </span><span>days of his life alone, and his life ending by him passing away alone at the hospital. </span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>The purpose for my undertaking this challenge is to raise much needed awareness of Endocarditis. Had we have known about this condition and it’s symptoms following the initial replacement valve surgery in 2018, we feel that the loss of my father could have been prevented. Effective treatment of this condition needs to be undertaken at the earliest opportunity possible. Therefore by doing this challenge I hope to raise awareness of this complication to others who have a replacement valve or may do so in the future. Combined with this, any donations raised in the process will help fund further research for the British Heart Foundation as a tribute to my late father. </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p>Information from the British Heart Foundation:</p><p>The pandemic is the biggest challenge we've faced in our 60 year history.

My coach (Ben Heron) and I have decided to organise an event whereby we run the distance from the most northern part of mainland Ireland, Malin Head (County Donegal), to the most southern part of the island, Brow Head (County Cork) in the space of 24 hours. The total distance between these two regions is roughly 302 miles (486km), making this event extremely challenging! Members of the Level Up Academy along with their close friends and family will be involved in the event, each running varied distances that will contribute to the overall distance achieved on April 4th 2021. We felt that during these difficult times, this would be great opportunity for people to get involved in an event that adds a sense of purpose to their exercise, whilst raising money for an extremely worthy cause. This event is ultimately in memory of my incredible Dad who sadly passed away in his sleep on the 16th October 2017 to a suspected cardiac arrest at 50 years of age. Through raising awareness of cardiovascular disease and the impacts it has on so many families, we are also keeping my Dad's legacy alive and no doubt doing him extremely proud.</p><p>I would like to take the opportunity, on behalf of my family and I, to thank you for your donation regardless of the amount.

Despite the diagnosis we were told most kids live fairly normal lives and we did not know the full impact of this condition. </span></p><p><span><span style=""color: #262626;"">When Krish was a year old, he developed a problem with one of his legs and had to wear a splint to help protect it. Other than that, Krish lived a very healthy and happy life. He learnt how to ride a bike, he loved school, he was great with numbers, enjoyed eating out, going on holiday but most importantly he loved spending time with his family. </span></span></p><p><span>Sadly, in October 2020 Krish, aged 5, very suddenly and quickly became unwell. On the 18th October he was admitted at GOSH for emergency brain surgery. As the days went by, we were told of the severity of what was happening to him. He was diagnosed with an inoperable malignant brain tumour. There was nothing we could do to save our son. </span><span>As parents we decided to fight for Krish and help him get stronger to be able </span><span>to complete radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatment. This was never going to </span><span>cure Krish but would buy us some time with our precious little boy. </span><span><br/></span></p><p><span>As we got ready to start treatment Krish's tumour grew rapidly and sadly he was unable to start treatment. He died in our arms on 9th December at 17:42 leaving us totally devastated. </span></p><p><span>Krish was a very strong and brave boy, he was a real superhero.<br/>We had to make tough decisions for him. When we decided to put Krish through treatment, he decided he did not want this, he must have thought he would suffer and so would we. We were then getting ready to bring him home to spend his last days with us, even then Krish decided he did not want us to remember him this way at home. He died in hospital surrounded by his family. </span></p><p><span>The speed with how all this happened is still something we are<br/>struggling to understand. During the seven weeks we were at GOSH the care and compassion we experienced was exceptional and we will always be very grateful to the Koala and Intensive care wards.The medical, nursing and support staff were outstanding, we never doubted the care Krish received.</span></p><p><span>We also now know that the prognosis of these types of tumors is not good and there is very little funding allocated to research in this life destroying field. This type of cancer kills many children, despite this, there is very little funding allocated to research . Therefore, we have decided to help raise funds for GOSH to be able to carry out clinical trials and research in this area.</span></p><p><span>All funds will be allocated to Koala ward and to research of these specific brain tumors. </span></p><p><span>We really want Krish's life to mean something, and we would like<br/>him to continue to be in our memories. <span>For those that knew Krish, you will know he was kind, clever, happy and a very loving beautiful boy. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Please share this page with family and friends and help us keep Krish in our memories.Any little thing that we can do in Krish’s  memory that can help other children and parents , will be  helpful.</span></span></p><p><span><span style=""color: #262626;"">Every donation helps Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity to provide the best facilities and equipment, research and develop new treatments, and support their remarkable patients and their families.</span></span></p><p><span>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.<br/>Your details are safe with JustGiving - they'll never sell them nor send<br/>unwanted emails.

So you will know that I’ve worked in special needs education for 5 years and I have seen a range of ways in which charities like GOSH change lives.

Unfortunately Amelia only got to meet her a few times before she passed away but loved her so much. Marie curie were amazing when they cared for her and was so supporting of the whole family who never left her bed side 24hours a day, with her best friend, her soul mate, her loving husband who done everything he could to make her comfortable and loved till the very last minute! Marie curie are so close to all our heart and we are forever thankful for the time and care they put into nan while she was at her end of life. Grandad also unfortunately passed away September 2020, who is now finally reunited with his love. We would love nothing more then to give a little back to Marie curie for the amazing help from them in such a sad and difficult time. Both my nan and grandad were foster caters for years and fostered 100s and 100s of children giving them the best life possible loving and caring for them as their own. This will be in memory of them both as we will never forget you, your always in our hearts love you both always and forever. <br /><br />It would be much appreciated if you could donate however small it is to give us the chance to thank Marie curie for their love and care <br /><br />Thank you! <br /><br />Mommy and Amelia <U+2764><U+FE0F>",NA,NA,"Mommy and Amelia's walk in memory for nan and grandad","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,"Steps",NA,NA,NA,NA,"https://images.justgiving.com/image/17702bb7-16cf-4553-8d44-b688d1ce9024.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true","https://images.justgiving.com/image/17702bb7-16cf-4553-8d44-b688d1ce9024.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true",NA,NA,NA,NA,"6563efa9-9b60-4ee9-aee3-1cf1a58d8ed8",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
