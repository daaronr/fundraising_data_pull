I must be mad. I will be doing this in memory of my father, Kevin, who sadly passed away in July 2019 due to major heart issues. This is why i have chosen to raise money for the British Heart Foundation. <U+2764></p><p>My father was a hard working man, even after suffering 4 major heart attacks he continued to work right up to retirement at 67 years of age! He loved his family and loved all of his grandchildren and we all adored him and loved him.  </p><p>He eventually made the move to live with me &amp; my wife and his 2 grandchildren in somerset  so we could look after him as his heart was causing him problems.  Even though this was only to be for a short period, i remember the fun he had with us and his grandchildren,  the laughter &amp; the smiles while playing table football. Him lifting one end of the football table so he would win&#128514; all great memories.  Him shouting at the tv when spurs werent doing too well. He was a huge tottenham fan<U+26BD><U+FE0F>( like myself)</p><p>One weekend in July 2019, my dad decided he wanted to go back to his home in London to collect his last possesions. I drove him home and returned 2 days later to a scene that will live with me and my family forever. My  12 year old son charlie ran in to see his grandad, to discover he had passed away. I wish i could have protected my son from this image. This is an image that will live with us forever.  If i could turn back time i would never have left my dad, and its gutting that we never had our chance to say goodbye.  </p><p>But i know my dad, and i know that he wouldnt want us moping around and being upset. He would want us to keep on going, keep on strong, keep on fighting &amp; living.....thats exactly what i intend to do! </p><p>I do have a liking for running so in a way to remember my dad, i have decided to set myself this challenge to keep my mind and body in tune and to raise money for a cause which may help to prevent further events like this for someone else<U+2764></p><p>It will be a gruelling year physically &amp; mentally but my dad and my family will be my motivating factor. I will be running half marathon, 10k &amp; 5k distances and hopefully a few races will reopen in 2021 if Covid19 does one! I have no time frames but i would be happy if i could hit a 1hr 35min half marathon, a 45 min 10k &amp; a 21 min 5k? </p><p>Thanks for reading my story and thanks for all of your support &amp; donations. Any donation will be hugely appreciated! </p><p>This is for you dad, Kevin Hedges , BIG K 1950 - 2019 <U+2764><U+2764><U+2764></p>","52 halfs, 10ks & 5ks in 52 weeks","10","0","40","8","0","819532","Kevin Hedges","/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/13530321","remember/819532","Kevin Hedges",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I'm raising money for the British Heart Foundation and I'd be so grateful for your support. I lost my dad in April 2016 to a cardiac arrest, myself and my brother were with him at the time and it’s something I wouldn’t wish on anybody. Anyone who knew dad wouldn’t say he was the perfect patient over the years but  also a fighter and an amazing dad.  Unfortunately I was very ill in June 2018 and the amazing cardiac and respiratory unit saved my life. This was a <span>hereditary condition and one I have adapted too. But as a result I am determined not end up like dad and I need to be fit healthy and well and live a long life. I loved running as a youngster was pretty good tbh and always wanted to do the London Marathon. This is a start to that and not begging demanding or ought like that. The  BHF has helped halve the number of people dying from heart and circulatory disease in the UK but sadly every day hundreds of people lose their lives.
