In January 2020, knowing it had started to spread, I had further breast tissue removed and a full lymph node clearance in my right arm. </p><p>I narrowly missed chemotherapy as a result of some impressive genetic testing and in March, began 20 rounds of radiotherapy just as the country went into lockdown.</p><p>Now, I have monthly injections and daily tablets and await an operation to sterilise me to prevent the oestrogen eating cancer coming back again!  </p><p>EVERY step of the way a Macmillan Cancer Support nurse was there, to support me, to catch me, to explain things to me, to tell me my test results, to book my appointments. </p><p>Cancer is the forgotten ‘C’ of 2020. Frightened patients of all ages are facing treatment alone because of COVID restrictions.</p><p>But the fortunate ones have a Macmillan nurse in their hospital. Some use the Macmillan website for clarification around alien words/procedures/medications, some pick up the phone and talk to a dedicated medical professional on the Macmillan helpline. </p><p>All this - and more - is threatened by a lack of fundraising! </p><p>I wanted to mark this day with an event to celebrate beating cancer.

The outcome from<br/>removing these resulted in an increase in performance primarily manoeuvrability<br/>in certain types of flight which allowed our pilots to match the later<br/>generation aircraft developed by the opposition.</p><p><span> </span></p><p>For those that are Spitfire enthusiasts there are a couple<br/>or three of botches partly due to the due to the fragile manufacturing of<br/>certain component parts and my heavy handedness i.e. the Starboard undercarriage<br/>which I had to add some additional plastic in order to strengthen it otherwise<br/>it would not have supported the airframe (perhaps a surveyor for that one).

My primary<br/>requirement was to capture the fine detail that the model manufacturer has seen<br/>fit to include i.e. rivets, seamlines etc.<span>  <br/></span></p><p>All parts of the model have been hand painted as I don’t<br/>possess a sprayer, this makes it a tad more difficult as applying paint by brush<br/>goes on much thicker than spraying. Consequently, I have used a dry brush<br/>technique which sort of works along with various types of washes the latter<br/>being diluted paint colourings)?</p><p>I am afraid its not a perfect example of model art if you’re<br/>a collector but, as this is a charity event perhaps both you and R J Mitchell<br/>(the aircraft designer) will forgive me for that. On the positive side you get<br/>something to dust, take up space around the house and maybe undertake further<br/>work on it?</p><p>I don’t normally do model aircraft as they are more<br/>difficult than my preference which is armoured fighting vehicles.

I wanted a youtube channel for the past year and a half been battling severe depression and had a tough time of it, to say the least!
It's a bit much to say Fifa has saved my life but sounds better than making life better and less sucky!
I was a total Fifa novice but spent a lot of time learning FUT and all the challenges involved helped me and now I want to give back to you
I will share my games on FIFA, SBC’s and the cheapest way of completing them, squad battles, transfer market, pack openings (both good and bad)
Please Don't forget to subscribe as this channel its different than most as we donate 50% of all Channel Profits to Mind the Charity, a very worthy and close to my heart cause!
And finally, I am looking to raise awareness and stamp out the stigma of mental health and hopefully raise questions and give some small hope for people in a similar position to myself.
Take Care of Yourself and if you can't find someone who can!</p>","FIFA SAVED MY LIFE","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"53922849-6e69-4322-addb-a2b7a21e32e5"

The Coronavirus Pandemic this year has significantly impacted the monies being donated to these worthwhile charities - money that is desperately needed to continue research and support functions of those charities.

Therefore the PENTEN and OITC teams have proposed a ""Virtual"" event where people may take part on the same day but in their own time whilst maintaining social distancing rules

OCD shift workers may also choose a different day to take part

Therefore for 2020 we will be raising money for the British Heart Foundation There is a choice of three events - indoor or outdoor

Cycling

Challenge 1 - Minimum 20 miles

Challenge 2 - Minimum 50 miles

Running

Challenge 1 - Minimum 5K

Challenge 2 - Minimum 10K

Walking

Challenge 1 - Minimum 5K

Challenge 2 - Minimum 10K

The event will take part on the 28th November 2020

So please join the Team and raise money as much money as possible for an extremely worthwhile cause

There is a small joining fee of £10 which of course will go towards the total raised.

So please register and Join in have fun and support a worthy cause!!!

I'm raising money for the British Heart Foundation by completing a virtual run from Lands end to John O'Groats. That is 874 miles and I'd be so grateful for your support.

Sounds a bit harder now doesn't it. Lol. </p><p>Over the years' the British Heart Foundation has helped my family a lot. A few years ago my Dad suffered a heart attack and had to have a heart valve replacement and fortunately made a full recovery. One of my cousins has also had a heart and lung transplant and without the help of the British Heart Foundation wouldn't be here today. I am also running in memory of Lucy's mum, Lynda, who sadly suddenly passed away nearly three years ago and is greatly missed every day.</p><p><span>BHF has helped halve the number of people dying from heart and circulatory disease in the UK but sadly every day hundreds of people lose their lives. It's only thanks to support from people like us that the BHF can create new treatments and discover new cures. £24 could pay for two hours of research by an early career scientist, but every pound helps so please give what you can to help me hit my target. I would love to be able to raise at least £1 for every mile but even more would be amazing.

I'm raising money for the British Heart Foundation and I'd be so grateful for your support.</p><p>I will be holding raffles throughout December to raise funds for BHF by giving away various gifts I have either already painted or to be painted in a colour of your choice. All I am asking is £1-£2 per raffle ticket which would go a long way in helping some one from not dying unexpectedly like my nan recently did.</p><p>In honor of my late nan, Jessie I will be fundraising as much as I can so loved ones do not have to face living without someone so suddenly who has a heart condition. </p><p>My nan had suffered several heart attacks which damaged her heart so badly without her knowing and she passed it off as indigestion, but she had an aneurism which caused her to suddenly be taking from us. She was fit and healthy on the outside throughout her life up until recent. She would be out every day doing something, to see her friends at the pop Inn, doing her shopping in the local town centre from the minute she woke or seeing her eldest brother to take him some sweet treats on a Friday. But when the lockdown happened, she became a shell of her true self and wouldnt step on a bus at all. Her anxiety sky rocketed and as much as we tried to help her get out, she would only travel local by car. Also due to the lockdown and her not getting out as usual, she put on the weight that she had lost and it had put a strain on her heart. She would fall asleep several times in the day, even while we were visiting. The doctors didn't see low oxygen levels but her blood pressure was low. Nothing was checked over thoroughly but she suffers from high blood pressure so that should have rung alarm bells for them. It was only when she suffered chest pains one night that she was taking into hospital where they found her heart was so badly damaged that one more heart attack would be the end of life for her. Being very reserved as she was, she never let us know that and 2 days later she suddenly passed. We weren't able to visit while she was in hospital so it was hard to accept. The condition she died from is rare and can be hereditary, so we will hope to be checked ourselves in the near future. </p><p>Anyone could have a heart condition they are unaware of and so it is so important that more awareness of them is spread. Please help if you can, to maybe save mine or your life next time.</p><p>The BHF has helped halve the number of people dying from heart and circulatory disease in the UK but sadly every day hundreds of people lose their lives. It's only thanks to support from people like us that the BHF can create new treatments and discover new cures. £24 could pay for two hours of research by an early career scientist, but every pound helps so please give what you can to help me hit my target.

I will be using semi permanent dye so for next month it will be definitely there to see. I will be doing on mums birthday 1/12/2020.

She had thought that this was just work related, as she (the most loving and caring person in the world) was a carer. She went to the Drs and through physiotherapy to try and do something about the pain, but it wasn't getting any better. Then in June she received a phone call telling her to get to James Cook now for a scan as they had reason to believe it may be cancer. That is a day I will never ever forget. Hayley drove us both to the hospital and I remember wheeling her through to the ward. It was shortly after that, where Cazzy found out the life changing news that she had cancer. In her true style though, she not only decided that she was going to beat it, she was also the one comforting others as she didn't want anyone to be upset!! She had even asked one friend &#34;why are you crying&#34;. She was determined to beat it, to get over it and say a big FU to cancer. Unfortunately this was never meant to be, she later found out that her cancer had metastasised - that is the medical word for spread - try to imagine the cancer is like a dandelion, cancer which metastasizes is like a dandelion blowing in the wind.<br/><br/>She had stage 4 Breast Cancer, with Mets. She knew it wasn't curable only treatable, she knew she would not beat the cancer, but she would not let the cancer beat her. Cazzy carried on doing the things she loved, she still went for meals, still met friends for drinks, she rehomed a gorgeous kitty and gave it love right up until she sadly lost her battle on the 20th of November 2020, peacefully in the hospice with family members present.<br/><br/>From conversations with Cazzy I know she would approve of raising money for charity, as charities have helped her and her family and they can help others.<br/><br/>She was also keen on getting people to talk about cancer and to be aware of the signs so that others wouldn't have to go through what she did, because of this I am now going to give you some information from NHS (2018) which is as follows:<br/><br/>CHECK YOUR BREASTS REGULARLY, check the full breast up to the armpit, this can be done when you shower and there are many tutorial videos out there if you are unsure how to do this.<br/><br/>Know what is normal for you, look and feel your breasts!<br/><br/>Look for any changes in size, outline, shape, change in your skin - eg puckering or dimpling, new lump or bumpy area, thickening of the skin, changes in the nipple position, if it is moist or red, if their is any discomfort and or pain around the area. If you are concerned SEE YOUR G.P! if you are not happy, get a second opinion!! <br/><br/>By sharing my best friends story I hope that people will be more aware and I hope that one day there will be a cure for this horrible thing that took her far too young &lt;/3<br/><br/><br/></p>","To Cazzy, we will continue your fight!","5","0","60","6","0",NA,NA,"Raising money because Cazzy always wanted to help others","Raising money",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Cazzy always wanted to help others","821723","Cazzy Murdoch","/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/13558538","remember/821723",NA,NA,"Cazzy Murdoch",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Ava gives up some of her packet money each week to donate to the adoption of a Snow leopard. Poppy her little sister is in the middle of choosing which animal to adopt through WWF. Both are learning more about each animal especially the cat family. They have both been telling everyone about the importance of climate change and what little things we can do to help.
