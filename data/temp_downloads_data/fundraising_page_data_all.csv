Sarah then suggested we take part in a 60 mile challenge, walking 60 miles throughout the whole of October (even crazier!)

However those that know us will know we love a drink or 3, so instead of just giving up the alcohol and getting our lazy bums out walking for our own personal benefit we decided to do it for Charity! 

Every 2 minutes someone in the UK is diagnosed with cancer. 

Statistics show 1 in 2 people in the UK will be diagnosed with some form of cancer during their life time.

We have chosen Macmillan as our charity, the work they do in supporting individuals and their families when they are diagnosed is amazing and really takes some of the pressure away from individuals and their families in their time of need. 

We will be tracking our walks and uploading pictures of where our adventures take us!

However this year I will be giving up chocolate for the whole of October to hopefully raise some money for the British Heart Foundation. I, like many others out there, have been personally affected by heart issues. I have lost loved ones,  have friends with heart issues and I myself had to have open heart surgery in May 2019 to repair a congenital heart defect I never knew I had. If it wasn’t for the amazing heart team who looked after me I may be living a very different life to the one I am able to lead now. Heart disease and defects claim so many lives every year and more research is desperately needed to help diagnose, treat and hopefully prevent such losses. Support for those affected is also vital and help is needed to continue to provide these services. Please support me this month and help me raise money for a very worthy cause. Any donation, no matter how small, will he very much appreciated.</p>","Natasha's dechox challenge for BHF","18.75","0","75","100","0","50946f46-9fa5-4c4e-8db7-b212a8f02f5b","true",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The BHF dechox challenge because I want to help raise money for further research","The BHF dechox challenge","I want to help raise money for further research",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our new Never Far Away: Essex Appeal aims to raise vital funds to support parent and family accommodation at GOSH. £300,000 will give families precious nights close to their children whilst they receive treatment at GOSH. 


We are asking the people of Essex to get behind this appeal, together we can make a massive difference to the families who are going through a very stressful time, if we can ease one worry then it is worth it. Whether you can raise £1 or £100; it will make an impact to so many families. 

A 7-night stay for 2 adults in a budget hotel 15 minutes from the hospital would cost a staggering £815. This is simply not affordable for most families.

One of my friends (Lou Buxton) and my Sister (Alison Foster) is also doing this challenge for their charity, Breast Cancer. I decided to join in on this challenge just to support Lou and wasn't going to set up a charity fundraising page but I thought why not? I realise that in these exceptional circumstances that it is difficult for people to donate. Please don't feel like you have to. Just follow my page to follow mine and our journey for October. Both charities are great causes and even if it raises awarenes then I know I have achieved something. </p><p>Great Ormond Street Hospital is a charity that many of you are aware is close to my heart. My son continues to be monitored under Great Ormond Street and the staff there are fantastic. There are many sick children that are treated at this hospital and they are constantly improving their facilities for the comfort of those children and their families. Please take a look at the charity website to see what they do to support Great Ormond Street. You don't have to donate here, you can also have a look at their shop as they have some beautiful bits on sale, especially in the run up to christmas.</p><p><span>Be prepared for lots of walking spam throughtout October. Every step counts! We are all supporting one another and I hope you can all support us.  </span><br/></p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure. Your details are safe with JustGiving - they'll never sell them on or send unwanted emails. Once you donate, they'll send your money directly to the charity. So it's the most efficient way to donate - saving time and cutting costs for the charity.</p>","Roisin's Walk 400,000 steps for October","0","0","0","0","0",NA,"true",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"I am walking and raising money because most of you know this charity means alot to me!","I am walking and raising money","most of you know this charity means alot to me!",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Me and Reece wanted to do something this year to give back to a cause that has had funding cut. COVID-19 has placed a huge strain on Cancer  researches income. We are walking to raise money for this incredible charity. Raising awareness for the charity, the struggles of funding over the covid period, getting a bit fitter in the process. Please kindly donate what you can, share our page and even join our team and walk 105 miles with us over October. 

Cuts to research a small snippet from Cancer researches website  :

Cuts to our life saving research are difficult, but sadly unavoidable. We plan to introduce a new research model, moving towards a lower level of funding of £250m a year within four to five years – a cut of £150m from what we had planned to spend.

It’s sadly inevitable that these cuts will deal a significant blow to our  ambitions and will slow progress as we make fewer discoveries, fund fewer trials and produce fewer therapeutic and diagnostic innovations to help patients everywhere.

The dreaded C word. </p><p>As most of you know I lost my younger brother Russell to Leukaemia more than 16 years ago.  Thought of Loved &amp; missed daily. My sister in law/ sister Jo was going through breast cancer at the same time as Russell going through leukaemia.   My nephew Jake’s Mum &amp; Dad.</p><p>Over the years a lot of my friends have gone through breast cancer and at the moment a very close friend is currently going through this. </p><p>I propose to A) donate my hair which was cut off when I was about 7 years old &amp; Maya’s hair from a similar age. Plus a ponytail of 7inches or more of my hair now....  This is to be sent to the Princess Trust Fund towards wigs made for children. B) this is the big one.... I will then have my head shaved to raise money for Cancer UK.  This will happen on Saturday 14th November. </p><p>Now if you know me well? Which most of you do. You will know I love my hair as most women love theirs. My hair makes me look not too bad when I’m dressed up and wearing makeup. I am pretty sure that with a skinhead I will look pretty ugly! However, I feel it is for a good cause. Plus my hair grows pretty quick and there is always wigs to be worn...</p><p>So please please dig deep and donate on my JustGiving page. No amount is too large or too small... So even if you can only afford £1 know that you have helped. </p><p>Thank you so much.  Positive Thoughts &amp; Energy, Peace Love &amp; Light to you all.
