To say this was a shock to her, and to us, her nearest and dearest, is an understatement. Luckily for us all, Laura’s (or Gibs as she always is to me, it feels weird typing her actual name) Cancer was picked up, operated on and removed, and thanks to our amazing NHS and her own inexhaustible resolve and positive attitude, she has gotten through the months that have passed us since. She has made remarkable changes to her lifestyle and shown bravery that astounds me all the time. Gibs has told us of the incredible support and guidance she has received from her Macmillan nurses in the aftermath of her experience, continuing to this day, and describes them as ‘angels’. It’s with this in mind that I have decided to do this challenge, as a small token of my gratitude to them for caring for someone so important to me. I only started running in Lockdown 1, so although this is no marathon, it feels a bit like one to me! I would be so grateful if you could sponsor me, any amount that you can, to support this amazing cause. I know there are families and friends not as lucky as we are, and the support provided by Macmillan must shine such a light into lives touched by Cancer. I promise I’ll do my very best to honour this amazing service, thank you to anyone who donates xxx","Lia's 10 5K in 10 days challenge","17.50","0","164.12","66","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We work for a world where people with sight loss are never left out of life. We work for a world where blind people no longer feel invisible, where the quality of their eye sight is genuinely the only difference between them and the rest of society.
