I see the affects of what cancer has on an individual and those around them on a daily basis. You never think it's something that'll affect you, until it does. </p><p>I am also a part time artist. I may not be in the position to do a sponsored run/walk/skydive/karaoke etc. but I hope to use my art to an advantage, for good... for change!</p><p>For every £2 that is donated towards Macmillan, your name will be put in a raffle for a one of a kind pet portrait, hand painted by myself. Any money that is raised beyond the goal, will be sent to a mental health charity - because mental health is just as important as physical health, to support individuals that may experience depression and/or anxiety as a result of cancer. Or if you have the means to, if you please consider donating because you'd like to.</p><p>I decided to do this because of a recent close family friends diagnosis.

I was being competetive, as usual. However, this accident, a broken wrist and my other calf torn (over the period of a few years) really impacted on my overall fitness and health. During the 2018 October break I got so concerned about my health I started to get some advice. A good friend, Lee Morrison helped me up, and on my way. It was the beginning of a road to recovery. I am pleased to report a great turn around in my health, encouraged also by my son as we got the bikes out and started cycling in the Cairngorms last summer.
