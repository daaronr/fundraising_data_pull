Your small steps will help Guide Dogs make giant leaps. Just one week of stepping can make a difference to the life of children and adults living with sight loss. Raise over £50 (£25 for children) and well replace those worn out socks with a brand-new Guide Dogs pair designed by an international fashion icon!

How your funds will change lives...

-	£50 could pay for fun, tactile activities to help children co-ordinate their muscles and movements.

-	£96 could pay for an eye test each for two guide dogs in training

-	£116 could buy a Training School Kit for one of our guide dog trainers who will teach pups the specialist skills they need as fully qualified guide dogs.

-	£710 could buy a Birthing Kit containing all the essential equipment for a guide dog mum to safely deliver her puppies.

Your small steps will help Guide Dogs make giant leaps. Just one week of stepping can make a difference to the life of children and adults living with sight loss. Raise over £50 (£25 for children) and well replace those worn out socks with a brand-new Guide Dogs pair designed by an international fashion icon!

How your funds will change lives...

-	£50 could pay for fun, tactile activities to help children co-ordinate their muscles and movements.

-	£96 could pay for an eye test each for two guide dogs in training

-	£116 could buy a Training School Kit for one of our guide dog trainers who will teach pups the specialist skills they need as fully qualified guide dogs.

-	£710 could buy a Birthing Kit containing all the essential equipment for a guide dog mum to safely deliver her puppies.

Your small steps will help Guide Dogs make giant leaps. Just one week of stepping can make a difference to the life of children and adults living with sight loss. Raise over £50 (£25 for children) and well replace those worn out socks with a brand-new Guide Dogs pair designed by an international fashion icon!

How your funds will change lives...

-	£50 could pay for fun, tactile activities to help children co-ordinate their muscles and movements.

-	£96 could pay for an eye test each for two guide dogs in training

-	£116 could buy a Training School Kit for one of our guide dog trainers who will teach pups the specialist skills they need as fully qualified guide dogs.

-	£710 could buy a Birthing Kit containing all the essential equipment for a guide dog mum to safely deliver her puppies.

Its thanks to people like you that we can continue to provide life-changing services. So, a huge thank you and lots of luck for your challenge!

The lifeboat was named after a popular local teenager Ollie Naismith who sadly died in a tragic road traffic accident in 2009. Ollies parents, Maxine and John Naismith spearheaded a fundraising campaign to raise the funds for the lifeboat which has gone on to save many lives in and around Looe including the life of Louis Webber, a young local lad who was of a similar age to Ollie. The lifeboat is now coming to the end of its operational life so the team at Looe Lifeboat station are teaming up with the Naismiths and Webber family to launch the Looe Lifeboat Appeal to raise the £78,000 required to provide a replacement lifeboat which will be named the Ollie Naismith II.

Clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene should be a normal part of everyone’s daily life. Without all three, people can’t live dignified, healthy lives. With all three, they can unlock their potential, break free from poverty and change their lives for good. With clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene, children are born healthier. They get the chance to go to school and grow up to become adults. Women and men get to earn a living. Whole communities start to thrive. It sounds normal and it should be.</p>",NA,NA,"A Kersley","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
