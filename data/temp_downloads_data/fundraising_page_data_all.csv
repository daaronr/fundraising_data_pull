He lived a full life and was high spirited to the end. During these difficult times, we know friends and family are not able to pay their last respects due to restrictions in the number of people who are allowed to attend his funeral.

Nothing unusual there you would think except that his father was blind following an industrial accident and never saw any of his four children.</span></p><p>Dad’s mother was a remarkable woman who stood by her fiancé and married him despite his disability. She also brought up their children and looked after him throughout their lives together. In order to help make ends meet,  she rented out rooms to three other blind people. This was not only to give those individuals a home where adapted accommodation would be difficult to come by in those days but also to provide some companionship for her husband.</p><p>Dad saw the challenges facing the blind first hand and later on how having a guide dog could have <span>helped his father and he was also a dog lover. </span></p><p><span>He will be delighted if more guide dogs were available to help blind people live an independent life.</span></p><p><span>Many thanks for your kind donation.</span></p><p>Paul and Heather</p>","In Memory of John William Robins","0","0","50","50","0",NA,NA,"John  Robins","812586","John  Robins","/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/13403562","remember/812586","Please make a donation instead of flowers because helping the blind was important to him","Please make a donation instead of flowers","helping the blind was important to him",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

You could complete 100 metres, 100 minutes, 100 days  be creative!

The sponsorship money you raise will make a difference. £100 could pay for five hours' training at a Guide Dogs training school.

It's thanks to people like you that we can continue to provide life-changing services, like our guide dogs, to people with sight loss. So, a huge thank you and lots of luck for your challenge!

And to honour her memory (she was a keen orienteer and ran mountain marathons pretty much up to the end) and (hopefully) raise some money for charity (Cancer Research) I decided I would run a marathon before I officially got old. So the challenge was to run a marathon before my 50th birthday - which should/would/could have been a fun/interesting/painful experience.</span><br/></p><p>However it has suddenly become a much more interesting proposition as almost every marathon has been cancelled due to Covid-19! Thus I am looking at the prospect of running a solo (virtual) marathon around my home area...<br/><br/>In support of this I have asked friends and family to help me on my marathon in a number of ways:<br/><br/>1. Runners or cyclists to run  / cycle at a socially responsible distance from me in the later stages of the race.<br/><br/>2. Virtual Cheerers (is that even a word?) to phone me and provide encouragement at the later sections of the race.<br/><br/>3. Physical Cheerers who may also have new water bottles and/or jelly babies.<br/><br/>4. People who are willing to Sponsor me.<br/><br/>If I get enough support I may (read could be convinced) be willing to try 50k before 50!<br/><br/>This marathon is likely to happen April next year (not due to training time - I'm up to half marathons in my training atm so I doubt I need quite that long!!) - mostly so the weather isn't appalling and to give me time to recruit friends to help. / support...and deal with any logistics!<br/></p><p>So Thanks for taking the time to visit my JustGiving page.</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

But above all she is my mom and a fantastic nanny to her grandchildren, there aren't enough words to describe how proud I am of her or how much I adore her. My wonderful mom has T cell lymphoma which is a rare form of cancer there're only a handful of cases diagnosed a year which makes diagnosis difficult and in the coming week she will start chemotherapy for 6 months, with a stem cell transplant once treatment has finished. So, of course to help cancer research and those it may effect in the future it's a no brainer to try and raise awareness as priority and money to help find a cure for anyone who is diagnosed with cancer. Therefore I will be doing a 30 mile sponsored walk over the coming weeks. I'm hoping I can do more in coming months with social distancing in mind where others can take part too. This hits home for many people, so together I'm determined we can make a difference.
