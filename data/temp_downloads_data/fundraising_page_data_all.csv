Our four-legged fundraisers support the 400+ fundraising groups across the UK from Glasgow to Plymouth and everywhere in between.

Due to the current situation, most of our fundraising groups will not be out collecting this festive season, and our four-legged fundraisers will be very much missed! We hope you will do your bit and help us as we aim to raise enough for 12 new guide dog partnerships! Heres how you can join in:

I’m 17, and it’s the toughest Christmas I’ve had. There’s an empty space at the table where Mum should be. Just a few months earlier, the cancer had returned, suddenly and brutally, and taken her away. Ten years earlier, when she was 40, she had fought and “beaten” breast cancer…only for it to return, savagely, a decade later.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Looking back, I’m so grateful that research developed the drugs that allowed me to get to know my mother. The difference between losing a parent aged 7 and 17 is immense. More recently, I have another significant reason to be grateful to Cancer Research UK, as they generously fund life saving research in my lab, as we look to develop medicines of the future and stop more families losing loved ones before their time.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>This year, many more people will have spaces at the table, where a loved one should be. Many of these spaces are directly due to cancer, many directly due to COVID-19, many cancer deaths may be indirectly related to the pandemic, as patients needed to stop treatment prematurely. Whichever way you look at it, directly or indirectly, the coronavirus pandemic has cost a huge number lives. Looking forwards, the huge hit that charities have taken to their income resulting from the pandemic has meant that world class, life saving science has gone unfunded, or with reduced budgets*, meaning more lives may be lost moving forwards as an indirect result of the pandemic. At Christmas time, let’s try and remember those charities that have been hugely impacted, if you possibly can.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>So, that’s why this Christmas Eve, I shall be teaming up with old pal and Media Volunteer Liaison Manager at Cancer Research UK, Tom Bourton, to each run a half marathon to raise funds for Cancer Research UK. “Why a half marathon each?” I hear you cry. Truth be told, I’m certain my knackered hip and bad back won’t manage a full 26.2 miles. Tom is younger and fitter that me and does marathons in his sleep but tells me something about a bad knee - but I’m not sure I believe him! Perhaps between us we make a fully functioning human! Mainly though, it’s symbolic. By running a half marathon each, representing the researcher and the fundraiser, it feels as though we are demonstrating how we are working side-by-side (metaphorically, of course, in an age of social distancing) to reach a common goal. On Christmas Eve, that common goal will running 26.2 miles, raising as much money as possible along the way. By doing so we might just help inch our way towards the real goal…to beat cancer sooner.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>So, if you might have sent me a card, or bought me a pint over Christmas, please don’t – but if you can spare that quid or two towards this challenge, I’d be hugely grateful!</span></p><p><span>*In May 2020, we set up the #Baton4Cancer initiative so that researchers across Wales could help raise much needed funds for the charities which generously fund our research.

A Drink With Friends 2020.<br/><br/>This is especially important in a year that - I think we can all agree - has been a bit rubbish.<br/><br/>Just like last year, as the clock strikes 7pm GMT on Christmas day, wherever we are - traveling, at home, at the pub, (unlikely this year) everyone grabs a drink (doesn't have to be alcoholic) and makes a toast to all the friends and family that have made a difference in our lives.<br/><br/>Following the success of this in previous years, please forward the invitation onto friends and family that you would like to be involved. The more people, the more this will mean - certainly to me.<br/><br/>It would brilliant if we could have something to say as the clock strikes 7pm... So I was thinking something simple like:<br/>&#34;Wherever I am, I'll be with friends and loved ones. Here's to you all and what you mean to me&#34;<br/><br/>Hopefully it's not too cheesy, and puts in a sentence what I wanted this to be about.<br/><br/>I never expected so many to be involved with this event over the years, and to some it has become a tradition! It still shocks me every time I look at the totals of shares that happened each year and the number of people who 'attended'. So much so, that I have re-opened my JustGiving page in case some of you would like to help me to raise a little cash again for a good cause.<br/><br/>In 2008, I lost my mum to cancer, so I thought it would be an awesome idea to give you all an opportunity to donate a little something to Cancer Research UK, however small. I’ve set up https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising-edit/drinkwithfriends2020 for us to use. I’m not expecting any of you to donate – it’s a tough time of year even without the economy being in the state that it is in, but if you feel generous and capable, please give whatever you can.<br/><br/>I'm targeting £1,000 in total, but thanks to previous years, we have already raised more than £1,400 (which is AMAZING &#128578; &#128578; &#128578; )<br/>If you don’t want to donate, then it’s no problem – I still look forward to sharing a moment with you on Christmas day, and hope to see all the awesome photos that will be shared!<br/><br/>I hope you'll join me in this small gesture - it wont change the world, but it is important to stay connected even if it is by a mutual act, one that stretches across borders and time zones.<br/><br/>Of course if anyone wants to upload pictures of themselves raising their glass - I'll certainly welcome it.<br/><br/>Let's make this Christmas another one to remember.<br/><br/>Thanks for being involved!<br/>Peace,<br/>SVDThanks for taking the time to visit my JustGiving page.</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

Its a warm and welcoming place where we give expert care to people with a terminal illness, and their loved ones, every day of the year. 

Our hospice team includes doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, social workers and many more, and is supported by over 200 volunteers  who play a vital role in the running of the hospice.

We have a 24-bed in-patient unit, where relatives and friends can visit any time of the day or night, and stay with their loved ones if they wish.

Our out-patient unit offers clinics, therapies and group sessions  and freshly cooked lunches made by our chefs. We also support carers and families, including children, with practical advice, counselling and bereavement support groups.

We need to raise £9,600 per day to run the hospice, so every penny counts. Thank you for helping to make sure more people with a terminal illness in Solihull get the care and support they need.

Such a lovely and interesting man, he really lived a full life. <span>               </span></p><p><span>Every time I stopped off at Geoff’s desk he would have a new discovery to tell me<br/>about.

Over the years we had many epic battles on the squash<br/>court. Most recently during the interminable office moves I somehow ended up<br/>with a very large framed photo of Everest by my desk, taken by Geoff during his trek.

He used to arrive in the office &#34;for the night shift&#34; in the late afternoon dressed all in black like a stato ninja. RIP Geoff.<span>  </span></span></p><p><span>I remember Geoff to be very nice, calm and helpful... </span></p><p><span>I remember the days when he was asking for different global databases and the email always came through late evening. I<br/>used to think he was based in a different time zone before realising he was actually based in the UK. He was very kind, polite and helpful when I had stats questions.<span>  </span></span><b><span style=""color: #333333;""></span></b></p><p><span>I too remember Geoff in the best of lights – as an incredibly warm and friendly man, always happy to have a chat and share some insightful advice. His loss will be keenly felt by all who knew him, myself not least of all.</span><b><span> </span></b></p><p><span>I was fortunate to work with him on a couple of projects (T-Mobile<br/>segmentation springs to mind, if memory serves me correctly), and as you rightly say he was very gifted but also just a fundamentally decent man, with a great sense of humour.<span>  </span>I know he was Scottish but we never really talked about our shared heritage, other than the fact he really supported the Scotland women’s football team, this was well<br/>before women’s football was more widely highlighted in the media as it is nowadays, which is why I remember.<span>  </span>I know he was a keen mountaineer for some time too and had trips to far flung places including Nepal.<span>  </span>I recall his disappointment on one such trip where he was taken ill early on and had to abandon his plans for scaling at least part of Kathmandu I think, but as ever when recounting the story to me on his return he was able to look on the bright<br/>side and find reasons to be thankful.<span> <br/></span>RIP.<span>  </span><b><span> </span></b></span></p><p><span>I remember the first email I received from Geoff. It was more like a<br/>letter rather than an email. I spent 40 minutes to ‘decode’ his email. It was the time when I just started my first job in London and I thought there must be something I’m missing on his email as my understanding on statistics and my work was very limited. Later on, I realised that his email wasn’t full of statistical jargons but it was full of his warmth and humour. He helped me so much when I first joined the company, guiding me not to feel lost. He was a very special person with an incredible humour, a warm and down to earth heart,<br/>and a brilliant talent. I will always remember his kindness.<span>  </span></span></p>","In Memory of Geoff Inglis","0","0","20","2000","0","Donations in memory of Geoff because he was a supporter of the RNLI's work","Donations in memory of Geoff","he was a supporter of the RNLI's work","Geoff Inglis","824475","Geoff Inglis","/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/13597831","remember/824475",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
