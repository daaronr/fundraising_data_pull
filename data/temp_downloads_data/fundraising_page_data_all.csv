Although she had been living with cancer knowing it was terminal, her final 24 hours were unforeseen and shocked us all.  No one could have predicted the complications or hidden problems mum had developed so quickly. Covid meant we held mum's hand through latex gloves and behind full PPE as she passed away. Covid has prevented us from seeing her again in rest to say goodbye. These are awful and heartbreaking times for us. </p><p style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Macmillan provided fantastic support to mum, being there for her and contacting her to always let her know someone would always listen and understand what she was going through in what must have felt an incredibly lonely journey. </p><p style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Christmas will be a little less bright for us this year but we would love to help support others who are currently in a similar situation to where our mum was. Macmillan provide support and help to families as well, because it hurts everyone around those loved ones too. Instead of cards or, gifts, or if you are feeling festively generous, please feel free to donate to Macmillan, who change lives and help those going through the unimaginable.

The stream will consist of myself and friends playing a variety of games together, having a blast whilst we do our part in helping those who need it the most. 

Cancer is a horrible disease, it has taken many of my loved ones, my friends loved ones and many others. We all need to pull together and beat this once and for all.

No one should face cancer alone. Let's put up a fight and give back to such a wonderful charity that work so hard to help our loved ones.

All donations are welcome, big or small, it helps to give to an amazing cause. All proceeds go directly to MacMillan.

Thank you for reading & your support.

I'll be running 31 miles throughout the month to raise money for Great Ormond Street Children's hospital, a charity very close to our hearts<span> (GOSH Charity) . </span></p><p><span>In October 2017, just 7 weeks after our middle son Freddie was born we was about to start a journey we never imagined. 48 hours after being admitted into hospital by an ambulance, a lumbar puncture, IV antibiotics and an oxygen machine, we was told ‘the next 24 hours were critical’ after not responding to antibiotics. I couldn’t imagine leaving the  hospital without my 7 week old baby boy, it was the worst time of my life. BUT 5 days later Freddie came home. </span></p><p><span>Still unaware of his condition we was being told it was just bronchiolitis and would stop come the spring, April 2018 came and we lost count the times we was blue lighted into A&amp;E back on oxygen and antibiotics. A mother’s instinct that something just wasn’t quite right so we got referred to Great Ormond Street hospital where we met the most amazing doctors and nurses who I will forever be grateful to. One consultant knew almost instantly what was going on with Freddie and after numerous tests it was confirmed Freddie had a condition called laryngeal cleft, a rare condition that will occur 1 in 20,000 births and usually happens at week 6 of pregnancy. </span></p><p><span>On our journey at Great Ormond Street hospital I met another mum of a little boy who was 5 months old. After sharing stories of why we was there she told me her son was diagnosed with a rare blood cancer at 3 months old and was having treatment to just prolong his life, his condition was terminal. What was worse she had lost her 5 year old daughter to a heart condition the year before, just utterly heartbreaking and a lady I will never forget. What mum deserves to loose both of her children before school age!  </span></p><p><span>After an operation and a few hospital stays Freddie was ‘fixed’. We still have annual hospital checks to make sure his lungs are doing ok but he was definitely one of the lucky ones. Some children will never leave that hospital or even get to have a Christmas/birthday in their own home with their family and this is where the charity for Great Ormond Street comes in. The NHS fund the hospital with the treatments provided to the patients but making the hospital a home for hundreds of children who will never leave or get to have a Christmas/birthday at home is where they need our help with donations. They have special day staff which play with the children, supply toys whilst the sick children can’t leave, craft afternoons and much much more but without donations this wouldn’t be possible, which is why I will be running 31 miles in January to help raise money. </span></p><p><br/></p>","Katie's running for GOSH ","5","0","30","30","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"https://images.justgiving.com/image/1c0ad5f2-de98-4043-8047-3918c4456f6f.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true","https://images.justgiving.com/image/1c0ad5f2-de98-4043-8047-3918c4456f6f.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true","73d345e9-c72b-4dff-b0f6-ebe17ca58037","https://images.justgiving.com/image/c43c8487-8fcf-451d-82f0-6712ed53299d.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true","https://images.justgiving.com/image/c43c8487-8fcf-451d-82f0-6712ed53299d.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true","https://images.justgiving.com/image/7080c644-abd3-48e0-b1c8-695699479551.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true","https://images.justgiving.com/image/7080c644-abd3-48e0-b1c8-695699479551.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true","https://images.justgiving.com/image/7876a377-ea09-4651-b390-3919997bb240.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true","https://images.justgiving.com/image/7876a377-ea09-4651-b390-3919997bb240.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
