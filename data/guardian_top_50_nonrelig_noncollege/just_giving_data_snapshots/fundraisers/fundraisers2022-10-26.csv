My paternal grandmother passed away from Cancer before I was born. Back then, the correct diagnosis took time, and my family struggled with the expensive treatment suggested. The world didn’t have the right affordable technology to save her. </span></p><p class=""p1""><span>Then, when I was 15 years old, we got the absolutely awful news that my father was diagnosed with Cancer too. However, due to the tremendous progress in cancer research and diagnosis as well as the financial and emotional support my family received (not to mention his own steady resilience), he was able to fight it off and is healthy today.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>But if we want many others to be so lucky and beat the ‘emperor of all maladies’, we need to support people through the social, emotional and practical impact cancer can have.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>Today, more than 3million people are living with cancer in the UK and the WHO estimates that nearly 1 in 6 deaths globally were due to cancer last year. To fight cancer, we not only need to invest in research and treatment, but also need to support those living with cancer and their families across every stage of their cancer journey.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>Given the cost of living crisis, extreme action is needed as 1 in 4 people living with cancer in the UK feel that they just ‘can’t afford life’, according to Macmillan Cancer Support. So I’ll be cycling from London to Paris in next July to raise money for Macmillan, who provide vital cancer services, research, and campaign to achieve better cancer care, and support the cancer workforce as well as giving emotional, financial, and practical support to the patients and families of those suffering from the disease.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>Given that I didn't even own a road bike until earlier this summer, I am sure that cycling the 532km from London to Paris will definitely be a challenge. But this is personal for me (as I am sure it is for many) and I am committed to give my all to make sure I am ready between now and July, putting in the hours come rain, snow or shine so I can partake in what will be the most physical challenge of my life so far. </span></p><p class=""p1""><span>In return, I would be grateful if you could support me by donating and supporting the fantastic work that Macmillan Cancer Support do.</span></p>",NA,NA,Nishad's London to Paris Cycle Ride for Macmillan Cancer Support,0,0,100,6,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,https://www.justgiving.com/Nishad-London-To-Paris,/Nishad-London-To-Paris,United Kingdom,...Nishad's London to Paris Cycle Ride for <strong>Macmillan</strong> <strong>Cancer</strong>...,Nishad's London to Paris Cycle Ride for Macmillan Cancer Support,//images.justgiving.com/image/83656921-dc0b-4014-96e1-941ae1804135.png?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,86.18724,Nishad Sanzagiri,I am cycling the 532km from London to Paris,I want to help those affected by cancer.,2022-10-23T13:49:44,2116,7947942,2022-10-23T13:49:44,1800,13507,97eb1f02-8ee2-4c02-a5a5-a9000953d782,Macmillan Cancer Support,2116,2116,261017,https://www.justgiving.com/macmillan,2022-10-26T22:09:32Z

Since the pandemic and lockdowns: 1 in 6 children now struggle with their mental health - up from 1 in 9. The NSPCC has seen a 3x increase in children talking to Childline about sexual abuse within the family. And, a 53% in domestic violence.

We know that the right support at the right time can prevent both abuse and mental health problems from derailing the rest of a child's life.

£4 answers a call to Childline from a child suffering in a silence. £25 covers an hour of therapy - rebuilding lives after abuse. Every penny you raise can help put a child's life back on track. Every penny you raise is helping give thousands of children the support they need to dream of a brighter future.

Running is another passion of mine that has given me so much more than I could ever explain (especially friendships and restored physical and mental health). I ran my first marathon with Team in Training to support the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society in 2009. It was a wonderful experience and that race got me &#34;hooked.&#34; Many years and miles later, I have a new goal. I want to run all 6 of the Abbott World Majors Marathons. I've run 2 of them, meaning I have &#34;2 stars&#34; - Boston and Chicago. The London Marathon is next on my list. After I run Houston in January, the London Marathon will be my 20th Marathon, my 1st international marathon and my &#34;3rd star in the Abbott World Majors Marathons.&#34; As one of my favorite 80's songs states, I'll be &#34;halfway there&#34; and I'm always &#34;Livin' on a Prayer.&#34; Thank you for supporting me in my goal to fight child abuse and my dream to run the 6 World Majors Marathons.

Our care of survivors of modern slavery has highlighted the exploitation of both men and women in a variety of ways including forced labour on farms, in factories, on building sites, in car washes, nail bars, and criminal activity such as cannabis farming as well as sexual exploitation and domestic servitude, some suffering domestic abuse. 

The Salvation Army provides and coordinates Safe Houses, and outreach support for such survivors. Each resident receiving Salvation Army support is respected and valued as an individual and the support they are offered is holistic and tailored to meet individual needs.

Dad had several spells in hospital but they couldn’t do much to help his condition. </p><p>On 27 September we were told he also had lung cancer. He went into hospital extremely ill on 28th September and passed away from heart failure at 3pm.  The doctors managed to resuscitate him long enough for us to spend some time with him.  Those few hours we are all truly grateful for. We got chance to tell him how loved he was and how he’d made all our lives that bit better. </p><p>On 29 September at 11am Dad fell asleep and his heart stopped.  Although he had cancer, we feel his heart was the thing that took such a beautiful soul from us. </p><p>For this reason we had flowers from immediate family and asked for donations to be sent to British Heart Foundation.  For those unable to do it on the day, and who would like to pay tribute to him, we’ve set up this page. </p><p>Thank you everyone for the cards and kind words we’ve all had in the past month as a family we feel grateful for the love you’ve shown us. </p><p>Goodnight God Bless Aged P we will all miss you always ❤️</p>",NA,NA,In memory of Dad (Sandy/Richard),7.50,0,115,115,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1019540,Sandy (Richard) Hollock,/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/16055465,remember/1019540,Sandy (Richard) Hollock,NA,NA,In memory of Sandy (Richard) Hollock,https://www.justgiving.com/Jackie-Portman1,/Jackie-Portman1,United Kingdom,,In memory of Dad (Sandy/Richard),//images.justgiving.com/image/c3b0dc9a-62da-4443-849a-e8af5012d67f.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,46.539925,Jackie Portman,Our page is in memory of our beautiful soul,He sadly passed away on 29/9/2022,2022-10-25T19:15:19,183092,7951468,2022-10-25T19:15:18,100,641389,95d7542c-b37c-4a92-8a02-2eabb01bccd0,British Heart Foundation,183092,183092,225971,https://www.justgiving.com/britishheartfoundation,2022-10-26T22:09:32Z

I had no choice (or problem!) in this, but it was certainly fitting. <span>Unfortunately, my grandfather who meant a lot to me, passed away just over a week before I signed up. In his final days he moved from hospital into a hospice. I was aware of hospices before, but I experienced first-hand the excellent care he received benefiting both him and us as a family.

Too many still face isolation and depression, The RNIB provide help and equipment to help people those families living with  sight loss give them the chance to have a normal life. </p>",NA,NA,Andy's page,0,0,45,2,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,46c605f1-649b-4602-b3c7-44cefc3accb4,NA,London Marathon 2023,https://www.justgiving.com/Andy-Dibben24,/Andy-Dibben24,United Kingdom,,Andy's page,//images.justgiving.com/image/9eb1ad4a-9be1-4bfa-a27b-6408ba0516b5.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,48.00156,Andy Dibben,I am Running the London Marathon 2023,of my Mum,2022-10-23T14:19:35,156,6202477,2023-04-23T00:00:00,2000,12235,55aed0be-5ca3-40de-8b84-122e764fb948,RNIB - Royal National Institute of Blind People,156,156,226227,https://www.justgiving.com/rnib,2022-10-26T22:09:32Z

The Corps of Drums from HM Royal Marines Portsmouth are walking 121 miles in November to raise money for the Royal British Legion. The RBL is an amazing charity helping service people and families around the UK. Throughout November we, as the Corps of Drums will be engaging in various high profile events including playing the Last Post at the Cenotaph in London and taking part in the Royal British Legion Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall. These events mean so much to us and we thought what better way to give back to the charity than raise some money by walking the 121 miles during our rehearsals and the events themselves.

Guide Dogs has given me more than 23 years o independence and freedom. My WHY is purely to say thank you. I've been proud to volunteer with the charity since 1998, but here, for the first time without a guide dog since 2 August 1999 and having had the worst year of my life - hands down, I realised, in a cab on my way home that life is what you make it. I questioned what has been absent for me in 2022 and the answer is clearly one word - HOPE.</p><p>Over the years, I've done some pretty daft things to raise money for the charity I owe so much to from bearing the physical scars of breaking my hip in 2008 running the London Marathon (you can read about that at just giving.com/themarathanmen ) to blind walking 90 miles for Guide Dogs with Siobhan to name Guide Dog Pup Dilley and even to get together with my mate Dave to name a guide dog Pup Finn, who's working with his owner in Leeds as we speak, I've always had the gratitude and crucially the confidence to put my hand up and say, we can do this.</p><p>2022 has isolated and to a great extent, trapped me as I am now a full time cane user until the right match com3s up with the right dog, at the right time for me. I've been told that match is likely to take two years due to the very specific matching requirements - but in the UK, there were around 5,000 guide dogs before the pandemic... now due to a mix of Guide Dogs stopping their breading programme for social distancing and safety reasons to not being able to socialise dogs in realistic situations, there are fewer than 4,000. If you think about that, 1 in 5 people who had a guide dog before the pandemic now does not.</p><p>It would mean the world to me if you could help me and work with me to name a guide dog pup HOPE before Christmas. Any amount of pennies you feel you can chuck in would be gratefully received and 100% of it will go to HOPE of 2022.</p><p>On a personal note, I need to regain the confidence this year has robbed from me. I'm prepared to do some pretty stupid things to hit the target. If you don't want to see me doing stupid things like the 90 mile walk through dangerous conditions, dig deep :)</p><p>Also, if we haven't spoken in a while, why not say hello. You'd be surprised the good that could do.</p><p>Ok so thank you everyone. Keep it here for updates and expect lots of different fundraising ideas to emerge until we hit the target. How quickly can we do it? Thank you all SO much.</p><p>==============</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to visit my JustGiving page.</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

I hope you all are well. As part of charity week, I am planning to walk 10,000 steps a day to raise money for orphans and vulnerable children.<br /><br />As somebody who is passionate about social mobility, I found this cause extremely important to my heart. Every child deserves the best start in life and the right support and resources to do so. As Muslims, we have a duty to care for the poor and vulnerable (and that includes children). As Allah (swt) says in the Quran:<br /><br />'Be good to orphans and the needy. Speak nicely to people. And help the poor' [Surah Baqarah, ayah 83]<br /><br />Furthermore, in Islam, orphans are respected and honoured like ordinary children. There is immense respect for the Muslim who takes care of orphans. The Prophet Muhammad (saw) said: <br /><br />''I and the person who looks after an orphan and provides for him, will be in Paradise like this,"" putting his index and middle fingers together. [Sahih al-Bukhari, 6005]<br /><br />If you can donate even a pound, it can go a long way to help transform children's lives ❤️<br /><br />Jazakallah for your donation and may Allah (swt) reward you all.

I am off anti-depressants which I started<br/>in my early 20’s, I’m fitter than I’ve ever been and my outlook on life is very<br/>different. So much so, here’s the next challenge…London 23rd April 2023…26.2<br/>miles.</p><p>Whoever you speak to that has done this event will tell you<br/>it’s the most amazing experience …but it’s also a bit brutal. Not just on the<br/>day when that wall you are likely to slam into has the strength to literally<br/>take you off your feet, the lost toenails, the chaffing, the dodgy stomachs after<br/>endless energy gels (I’m not really selling this, am I?). But the 20 (ish)<br/>weeks that it takes to get you into a position where you are ready physically<br/>and mentally. At this time of year that means cold mornings, dark nights,<br/>horizontal rain, wind, sleet and who knows maybe a bit of snow? This is why I<br/>always said my first (and possibly only) marathon, not only had to be London,<br/>but also, for charity as its people believing in you, cheering you on and<br/>donating to your cause that gets you out of bed and out that door. </p><p>I am running for #teambarnardos, who I am so honoured to<br/>work for. As fulfilling as working for a charity is, it’s also heart-breaking<br/>to hear some of the stories behind the children, young people, parents, and<br/>carers across the UK who we support. The issues that we face are very different<br/>from when the charity was first established, but the message remains the same: <b>that<br/>all children and young people deserve the right to a happy and safe childhood. </b></p><p>Barnardo’s work in championing social reforms for children<br/>is as relevant now as it was back in the mid-1800’s. The stories of<br/>trafficking, sexual abuse, violence, mental health and online safety are signs<br/>of the times and access to vital services, and giving these vulnerable members<br/>of our society a voice where it matters couldn’t be provided if it wasn’t for<br/>your donations to this fabulous charity.</p><p>If you’d like to read more about the work that we do, please<br/>go to <a href=""http://www.barnardos.org.uk"">www.barnardos.org.uk</a>. </p><p>Thank you for taking the time to read my story…now please<br/>click that donate button and I’ll get my trainers on…this is for you and the<br/>kids <span>&#127939;&#127995;&#8205;♀️&#127939;&#127995;&#8205;♀️</span>.</p><p>Nicole x</p><p></p>",NA,NA,London Marathon 23rd April 2023,50,0,205,9,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,London Marathon 2023,https://www.justgiving.com/nicole-zorn,/nicole-zorn,United Kingdom,,London Marathon 23rd April 2023,//images.justgiving.com/image/253d7848-33a4-455b-8d87-ae8e3501ba79.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,17.624542,Nicole Zorn,I am running the London Marathon,children deserve to have a happy & safe childhood,2022-10-24T13:58:28,88,6202477,2023-04-23T00:00:00,2200,11915,b0aae8c0-9957-45ab-81dd-fd2385027773,Barnardo's,88,88,216250,https://www.justgiving.com/barnardos,2022-10-26T22:09:32Z

Now, my grandmother Pat is suffering the same terrible illness.</p><p><span>Whilst I was young at the time, the memories have stuck with me as I slowly watched a man I had a mountain of respect for slowly regress as a person.</span><br/></p><p><span>My grandparents, Eddie &amp; May, came over from Ireland - they were in every sense each others rock. They made a lot of my summers whenever I'd go and visit them in Liverpool. I remember every morning grandad or nan making me Egg in a Cup before my grandad would take his daily walk to see his daughters grave and pop into his other daughters houses' for a cup. He was also a huge figure in his community, something I didn't truly grasp the scope of until I saw his funeral turn out.</span></p><p><span>When his diagnosis came, my nan, also in her advanced age, looked after my grandad as best she could before my Auntie Kath stepped in to become my grandad's full-time carer. My Uncle Paddy also helped where he could whilst he dealt with his own ailing health. They suffered alongside my grandad, making sure he was never left wanting and always in as much comfort as possible until he left us.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><span>Right now, my other grandad is looking after my nan, Pat, as she deals with the debilitating effects of Dementia. Nanny Pat &amp; Grandad Joe had just retired and moved out of London where they'd raised their 4 sons and looked after their 9 grandchildren.</span></p><p><span>Not long after moving my nan slowly started to become ill with the effects of Dementia. She was always someone I knew to have a sharp mind, keeping up with mind games like her sudoku. I have memories of her telling me to stop back-seat solving her sudoku puzzles as she was solving them. It truly cemented to me how this disease can bring anyone under its shadow.</span></p><p>Nan and Grandad had planned to travel the world once they'd settled into their new home but that dream was taken from they because of this cruel and unfair disease. Instead now my grandad is carrying the burden of looking after his wife. Luckily my grandad has some professional support as well as his family around him but the emotional and physical toll is all the same.</p><p>I'm running to raise support for my grandparents and people like them who're dealing with this every minute of every day.

Obviously I never expected to get in!!! &#128521; Then the next day I got an email to say I had a place and I’ll be honest, I’ve spent the last month trying to work out if I have the capacity for it. I’m recovering from a nasty injury and going through so much house moving stress that I wasn’t sure this was my time. But then my husband bought me a second hand treadmill and everything started to fall into place with the new house that I thought… why not!?
