I'm sure you all feel the same if you are one of my friends too as I never shut up about the benefits of running and how it has made a positive impact on myself and hopefully has inspired others to do the same. It's never too late. It's also given me the opportunity to get out there and raise some much needed funds for important charities over the past two years. Together we have raised over £2000. All this would not be possible with YOU!</p><p>So lets get this done and i'll run another 10k event and try and smash last years time.

My paternal grandmother passed away from Cancer before I was born. Back then, the correct diagnosis took time, and my family struggled with the expensive treatment suggested. The world didn’t have the right affordable technology to save her. </span></p><p class=""p1""><span>Then, when I was 15 years old, we got the absolutely awful news that my father was diagnosed with Cancer too. However, due to the tremendous progress in cancer research and diagnosis as well as the financial and emotional support my family received (not to mention his own steady resilience), he was able to fight it off and is healthy today.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>But if we want many others to be so lucky and beat the ‘emperor of all maladies’, we need to support people through the social, emotional and practical impact cancer can have.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>Today, more than 3million people are living with cancer in the UK and the WHO estimates that nearly 1 in 6 deaths globally were due to cancer last year. To fight cancer, we not only need to invest in research and treatment, but also need to support those living with cancer and their families across every stage of their cancer journey.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>Given the cost of living crisis, extreme action is needed as 1 in 4 people living with cancer in the UK feel that they just ‘can’t afford life’, according to Macmillan Cancer Support. So I’ll be cycling from London to Paris in next July to raise money for Macmillan, who provide vital cancer services, research, and campaign to achieve better cancer care, and support the cancer workforce as well as giving emotional, financial, and practical support to the patients and families of those suffering from the disease.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>Given that I didn't even own a road bike until earlier this summer, I am sure that cycling the 532km from London to Paris will definitely be a challenge. But this is personal for me (as I am sure it is for many) and I am committed to give my all to make sure I am ready between now and July, putting in the hours come rain, snow or shine so I can partake in what will be the most physical challenge of my life so far. </span></p><p class=""p1""><span>In return, I would be grateful if you could support me by donating and supporting the fantastic work that Macmillan Cancer Support do.</span></p>",NA,NA,"Nishad's London to Paris Cycle Ride for Macmillan Cancer Support","0","0","100","6","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Whether its together or a relay, backwards or in fancy dress, we want you to complete the challenge your way so we can support the more than 3 million people in the UK living with cancer.

Macmillan will do whatever it takes to help everyone with cancer live life as fully as they can. If youre diagnosed, your worries are their worries. They will move mountains to help you live life as fully as you can. And they dont stop there.

Since the pandemic and lockdowns: 1 in 6 children now struggle with their mental health - up from 1 in 9. The NSPCC has seen a 3x increase in children talking to Childline about sexual abuse within the family. And, a 53% in domestic violence.

We know that the right support at the right time can prevent both abuse and mental health problems from derailing the rest of a child's life.

£4 answers a call to Childline from a child suffering in a silence. £25 covers an hour of therapy - rebuilding lives after abuse. Every penny you raise can help put a child's life back on track. Every penny you raise is helping give thousands of children the support they need to dream of a brighter future.

It's efficient, saves time and cuts costs for the charity. </p><p>Life is short. I believe that we should dream big and make our lives count! I have been a Court Appointed Special Advocate since 2020 to help abused and neglected children in Houston. I'm a mom of 4 boys and I pray for their safety &amp; protection daily. Running is another passion of mine that has given me so much more than I could ever explain (especially friendships and restored physical and mental health). I ran my first marathon with Team in Training to support the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society in 2009. It was a wonderful experience and that race got me &#34;hooked.&#34; Many years and miles later, I have a new goal. I want to run all 6 of the Abbott World Majors Marathons. I've run 2 of them, meaning I have &#34;2 stars&#34; - Boston and Chicago. The London Marathon is next on my list. After I run Houston in January, the London Marathon will be my 20th Marathon, my 1st international marathon and my &#34;3rd star in the Abbott World Majors Marathons.&#34; As one of my favorite 80's songs states, I'll be &#34;halfway there&#34; and I'm always &#34;Livin' on a Prayer.&#34; Thank you for supporting me in my goal to fight child abuse and my dream to run the 6 World Majors Marathons.

Our care of survivors of modern slavery has highlighted the exploitation of both men and women in a variety of ways including forced labour on farms, in factories, on building sites, in car washes, nail bars, and criminal activity such as cannabis farming as well as sexual exploitation and domestic servitude, some suffering domestic abuse. 

The Salvation Army provides and coordinates Safe Houses, and outreach support for such survivors. Each resident receiving Salvation Army support is respected and valued as an individual and the support they are offered is holistic and tailored to meet individual needs.

Dad had several spells in hospital but they couldn’t do much to help his condition. </p><p>On 27 September we were told he also had lung cancer. He went into hospital extremely ill on 28th September and passed away from heart failure at 3pm.  The doctors managed to resuscitate him long enough for us to spend some time with him.  Those few hours we are all truly grateful for. We got chance to tell him how loved he was and how he’d made all our lives that bit better. </p><p>On 29 September at 11am Dad fell asleep and his heart stopped.  Although he had cancer, we feel his heart was the thing that took such a beautiful soul from us. </p><p>For this reason we had flowers from immediate family and asked for donations to be sent to British Heart Foundation.  For those unable to do it on the day, and who would like to pay tribute to him, we’ve set up this page. </p><p>Thank you everyone for the cards and kind words we’ve all had in the past month as a family we feel grateful for the love you’ve shown us. </p><p>Goodnight God Bless Aged P we will all miss you always ❤️</p>",NA,NA,"In memory of Dad (Sandy/Richard)","7.50","0","115","115","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1019540","Sandy (Richard) Hollock","/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/16055465","remember/1019540","Sandy (Richard) Hollock",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Zuleima is a 35-year-old mother of three from Venezuela. It is a country struggling beneath the weight of a massive economic crisis.

And this time it’s fuelled by bonfires, fireworks, guys Fawks and the spooky season. We are fundraising to support the DEC Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal. Heavy fighting, shelling and air strikes across Ukraine have had devastating consequences. Already, over two million people have fled their homes to escape intense conflict in Ukraine. Leaving behind loved ones, livelihoods and almost everything they own, they need shelter, food, and water. People are losing their homes and lives, essential services like water and healthcare have been hit and temperatures have dropped below zero. Please support my fundraiser to help reach those in urgent need in Ukraine and neighbouring countries. With your help we can support ActionAid and the DEC in scaling up their response and help families to stay warm and protect women and girls.  - £10 could provide essential hygiene supplies for 1person for one month - £50 could provide blankets for 4 families to keep them warm - £100 could provide emergency food for 2 families for one month </p>",NA,NA,"The Happiness Anonymous Flare Show for Ukraine","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"7a23ca6f-80a1-42ab-99d1-6db2beaee321",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Guide Dogs has given me more than 23 years o independence and freedom. My WHY is purely to say thank you. I've been proud to volunteer with the charity since 1998, but here, for the first time without a guide dog since 2 August 1999 and having had the worst year of my life - hands down, I realised, in a cab on my way home that life is what you make it. I questioned what has been absent for me in 2022 and the answer is clearly one word - HOPE.</p><p>Over the years, I've done some pretty daft things to raise money for the charity I owe so much to from bearing the physical scars of breaking my hip in 2008 running the London Marathon (you can read about that at just giving.com/themarathanmen ) to blind walking 90 miles for Guide Dogs with Siobhan to name Guide Dog Pup Dilley and even to get together with my mate Dave to name a guide dog Pup Finn, who's working with his owner in Leeds as we speak, I've always had the gratitude and crucially the confidence to put my hand up and say, we can do this.</p><p>2022 has isolated and to a great extent, trapped me as I am now a full time cane user until the right match com3s up with the right dog, at the right time for me. I've been told that match is likely to take two years due to the very specific matching requirements - but in the UK, there were around 5,000 guide dogs before the pandemic... now due to a mix of Guide Dogs stopping their breading programme for social distancing and safety reasons to not being able to socialise dogs in realistic situations, there are fewer than 4,000. If you think about that, 1 in 5 people who had a guide dog before the pandemic now does not.</p><p>It would mean the world to me if you could help me and work with me to name a guide dog pup HOPE before Christmas. Any amount of pennies you feel you can chuck in would be gratefully received and 100% of it will go to HOPE of 2022.</p><p>On a personal note, I need to regain the confidence this year has robbed from me. I'm prepared to do some pretty stupid things to hit the target. If you don't want to see me doing stupid things like the 90 mile walk through dangerous conditions, dig deep :)</p><p>Also, if we haven't spoken in a while, why not say hello. You'd be surprised the good that could do.</p><p>Ok so thank you everyone. Keep it here for updates and expect lots of different fundraising ideas to emerge until we hit the target. How quickly can we do it? Thank you all SO much.</p><p>==============</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to visit my JustGiving page.</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure. Your details are safe with JustGiving - they'll never sell them on or send unwanted emails. Once you donate, they'll send your money directly to the charity.

I hope you all are well. As part of charity week, I am planning to walk 10,000 steps a day to raise money for orphans and vulnerable children.<br /><br />As somebody who is passionate about social mobility, I found this cause extremely important to my heart. Every child deserves the best start in life and the right support and resources to do so. As Muslims, we have a duty to care for the poor and vulnerable (and that includes children). As Allah (swt) says in the Quran:<br /><br />'Be good to orphans and the needy. Speak nicely to people. And help the poor' [Surah Baqarah, ayah 83]<br /><br />Furthermore, in Islam, orphans are respected and honoured like ordinary children. There is immense respect for the Muslim who takes care of orphans. The Prophet Muhammad (saw) said: <br /><br />''I and the person who looks after an orphan and provides for him, will be in Paradise like this,"" putting his index and middle fingers together. [Sahih al-Bukhari, 6005]<br /><br />If you can donate even a pound, it can go a long way to help transform children's lives ❤️<br /><br />Jazakallah for your donation and may Allah (swt) reward you all.

This project is so special to me and so many of us- and it's making a real difference.<br /><br />Please help me make a difference to the lives of orphans and children in need by making a donation, to support these BEAUTIFUL causes: https://charityweek.com/projects/<br /><br />Zakat can be donated too: just type ""Zakat"" in the comment with your donation so we can ensure it is allocated appropriately!<br /><br />Please spread the word by sharing this page with your friends and family. May you be rewarded abundantly!<br /><br />#CW2022 #UnitedWeWin",NA,NA,"Tasneem's 10K Step Challenge","55.50","0","222","15","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,"https://images.justgiving.com/image/1449afc9-f05a-4fff-8366-f638b004581b.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true","https://images.justgiving.com/image/1449afc9-f05a-4fff-8366-f638b004581b.jpg?imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"e18762e1-8b77-46e1-904c-34e000dc0d77",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I was<br/>sick of not looking after myself; mentally and physically – I was overweight, I<br/>drank too much, and my anxiety was at an all-time high.</p><p>Nearly 2 years on, 2 half marathons under my belt, a few<br/>10ks, joining 2 running clubs, I’ve met so many new people who are so positive,<br/>inspiring and I’ve learned so much. I am off anti-depressants which I started<br/>in my early 20’s, I’m fitter than I’ve ever been and my outlook on life is very<br/>different. So much so, here’s the next challenge…London 23rd April 2023…26.2<br/>miles.</p><p>Whoever you speak to that has done this event will tell you<br/>it’s the most amazing experience …but it’s also a bit brutal. Not just on the<br/>day when that wall you are likely to slam into has the strength to literally<br/>take you off your feet, the lost toenails, the chaffing, the dodgy stomachs after<br/>endless energy gels (I’m not really selling this, am I?). But the 20 (ish)<br/>weeks that it takes to get you into a position where you are ready physically<br/>and mentally. At this time of year that means cold mornings, dark nights,<br/>horizontal rain, wind, sleet and who knows maybe a bit of snow? This is why I<br/>always said my first (and possibly only) marathon, not only had to be London,<br/>but also, for charity as its people believing in you, cheering you on and<br/>donating to your cause that gets you out of bed and out that door. </p><p>I am running for #teambarnardos, who I am so honoured to<br/>work for. As fulfilling as working for a charity is, it’s also heart-breaking<br/>to hear some of the stories behind the children, young people, parents, and<br/>carers across the UK who we support. The issues that we face are very different<br/>from when the charity was first established, but the message remains the same: <b>that<br/>all children and young people deserve the right to a happy and safe childhood. </b></p><p>Barnardo’s work in championing social reforms for children<br/>is as relevant now as it was back in the mid-1800’s. The stories of<br/>trafficking, sexual abuse, violence, mental health and online safety are signs<br/>of the times and access to vital services, and giving these vulnerable members<br/>of our society a voice where it matters couldn’t be provided if it wasn’t for<br/>your donations to this fabulous charity.</p><p>If you’d like to read more about the work that we do, please<br/>go to <a href=""http://www.barnardos.org.uk"">www.barnardos.org.uk</a>. </p><p>Thank you for taking the time to read my story…now please<br/>click that donate button and I’ll get my trainers on…this is for you and the<br/>kids <span>&#127939;&#127995;&#8205;♀️&#127939;&#127995;&#8205;♀️</span>.</p><p>Nicole x</p><p></p>",NA,NA,"London Marathon 23rd April 2023","50","0","205","9","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Now, my grandmother Pat is suffering the same terrible illness.</p><p><span>Whilst I was young at the time, the memories have stuck with me as I slowly watched a man I had a mountain of respect for slowly regress as a person.</span><br/></p><p><span>My grandparents, Eddie &amp; May, came over from Ireland - they were in every sense each others rock. They made a lot of my summers whenever I'd go and visit them in Liverpool. I remember every morning grandad or nan making me Egg in a Cup before my grandad would take his daily walk to see his daughters grave and pop into his other daughters houses' for a cup. He was also a huge figure in his community, something I didn't truly grasp the scope of until I saw his funeral turn out.</span></p><p><span>When his diagnosis came, my nan, also in her advanced age, looked after my grandad as best she could before my Auntie Kath stepped in to become my grandad's full-time carer. My Uncle Paddy also helped where he could whilst he dealt with his own ailing health. They suffered alongside my grandad, making sure he was never left wanting and always in as much comfort as possible until he left us.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><span>Right now, my other grandad is looking after my nan, Pat, as she deals with the debilitating effects of Dementia. Nanny Pat &amp; Grandad Joe had just retired and moved out of London where they'd raised their 4 sons and looked after their 9 grandchildren.</span></p><p><span>Not long after moving my nan slowly started to become ill with the effects of Dementia. She was always someone I knew to have a sharp mind, keeping up with mind games like her sudoku. I have memories of her telling me to stop back-seat solving her sudoku puzzles as she was solving them. It truly cemented to me how this disease can bring anyone under its shadow.</span></p><p>Nan and Grandad had planned to travel the world once they'd settled into their new home but that dream was taken from they because of this cruel and unfair disease. Instead now my grandad is carrying the burden of looking after his wife. Luckily my grandad has some professional support as well as his family around him but the emotional and physical toll is all the same.</p><p>I'm running to raise support for my grandparents and people like them who're dealing with this every minute of every day.

I’d never particularly run very far before but I wholeheartedly believe cats need our protection and, in these hard economic times, more than ever. So I thought, ‘Why not!’ and clicked to apply without hesitation. Obviously I never expected to get in!!! &#128521; Then the next day I got an email to say I had a place and I’ll be honest, I’ve spent the last month trying to work out if I have the capacity for it. I’m recovering from a nasty injury and going through so much house moving stress that I wasn’t sure this was my time. But then my husband bought me a second hand treadmill and everything started to fall into place with the new house that I thought… why not!? Cats need us - people like me, keen and mad enough to run some 26 miles for them, and people like you to follow the training story and give generously to our feline friends.</p><p><span>Thank you for your donation and getting behind us.

Nothing quite beats the euphoria of crossing the finish line, but for me the training process and the lead up to race day closely rivals it. I’ve always enjoyed the journey of getting there (wherever ‘there’ may be), with the aim of conquering some ‘small wins’ en route to the ‘big<br/>win’.</span></p><p><span>And so…</span></p><p><span>Each month from October to April, I'll be tackling 7 different<br/>races in 7 different areas of London, flying the flag for Shelter, with April's TCS 2023 London Marathon being the icing on the cake and the 7<sup>th</sup> and final race to celebrate all races. I've aptly named this challenge 'The Shelter 7.'</span></p><p><span>I'll be visualising this as a marathon sandwich, with two full<br/>marathons bookending the challenge, stuffed with a hearty filling of three 10km events and two half marathons (listed below):</span></p><p><span>Oct - Richmond Marathon<br/>Nov - Greenwich 10km<br/>Dec - Victoria Park Half Marathon<br/>Jan - Regents Park 10km<br/>Feb - Wimbledon Half Marathon<br/>Mar - Olympic Park 10km<br/>Apr - London Marathon</span></p><p><span>If you’re reading this, thinking “bit much?”, let me explain… </span></p><p><span>I’m going that little bit BIGGER, because this whole cost of<br/>living crisis is quite frankly making life that little bit TOUGHER for us all. I want to go the extra mile (or miles…) physically, to show how grateful I am for your donations during a time when we are all having to be that little bit more frugal! </span></p><p><span>Now more than ever Shelter need our support. </span><span>Thousands of people are urgently trying to just get by without a safe place to call home. They’re trapped in damp, unfit accommodation, fighting to keep a roof over their family’s heads, or in unhygienic hostels, sleeping in<br/>cars, tents or on sofas. Our country's housing emergency is spiralling. Every four minutes, even as you are reading this, another household becomes homeless. </span></p><p><span>Being able to do something I love (by running) and at the </span><span>same time champion those who have endured tough living conditions, support </span><span>those battling housing difficulties now and try to make conditions better for </span><span>those who may one day find themselves in this situation is an incredible </span><span>feeling.</span></p><p><span>With April just around the corner, I’m ready for the<br/>challenge and want to say thank you so much for your support.</span></p><p><span>Now off to pound the pavements of London… </span></p><p><span>Claire x</span></p><p><span>(T&amp;Cs - <span style=""color: #262626;"">Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.
