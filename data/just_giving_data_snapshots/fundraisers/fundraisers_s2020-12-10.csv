Macmillan Cancer Support is here to help everyone with cancer live life as fully as they can, providing physical, financial and emotional support. So whatever cancer throws your way, we’re right right there with you.</p><p>Usually at this time of year I do a Santa visit to the local pub and collect gifts for children less fortunate. Covid-19 isnt allowing that to happen this year so i thought why not do home visits and raise some money for a charity close to my families hearts right now whilst also putting a smile on some kids faces while they arent able to go and do the usual Santa visit they all look forward to so much.</p><p>I have chosen Macmillan because of the support and hard work they have shown my amazingly strong cousin during her battle with lymphoma. She is an inspiration to so many showing courage and strength and this is my way to help support her!</p><p>I am hoping to raise £600 to help make a difference. I would like to suggest a donation of £10 per household I visit but obviously anything you can afford will be welcomed and appreciated. <span>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and secure. Your details are safe with JustGiving - they'll never sell them or send unwanted emails. Once you donate, they'll send your money directly to the charity. So it's the most efficient way to donate - saving time and cutting costs.</span></p><p><span>So this is how its gunna work - Visits will be mostly on Sundays, contact me via the Facebook Santa page I have shared to book your time slot. </span></p><p><span>To minimise contact you as the parents will provide the gift for me to hand to the children, and leave it outside hidden for me to pick up on arrival for them. (I will be wearing gloves (Santa ones!) so no contamination will be made).</span></p><p><span>Once your time slot has been confirmed we ask you to make your donation to this page. </span></p><p><span>Finallly thanks for all of your support on what started as a little idea and you have all helped make it possible!</span></p><p><span>Merry Christmas! xx</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p>",NA,NA,Suprise Santa Visits,0,0,80,13,0,true,I am raising money because I want to put smiles on faces and help charity!,I am raising money,I want to put smiles on faces and help charity!,NA,Santa Visits,https://www.justgiving.com/Richard-Tunney71,/Richard-Tunney71,United Kingdom,,Suprise Santa Visits,//images.justgiving.com/image/3660da92-e8fe-4df3-a310-e3bf5bfccb02.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,9.354011,Rachel Johnson,I am raising money,I want to put smiles on faces and help charity!,2020-12-09T11:23:05,2116,6399398,2020-12-24T00:00:00,600,13507,2d205df1-6ba6-47ce-ba9d-f3eaa6133702,Macmillan Cancer Support,2116,261017,2116,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2020-12-10T06:17:47Z
