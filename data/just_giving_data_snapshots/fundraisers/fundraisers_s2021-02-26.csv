Quitting chocolate for a whole month to raise money and help save lives. Unfortunately due to the pandemic BHF has had to cut their research by half due to lack of funds, that’s why we need people like you more than ever to help raise money for this amazing cause.  <br/><br/>Let’s come together to make a difference. I am doing this in loving memory of those we’ve lost with heart disease or heart failure.<br/><br/>On this Dechox, I am cutting out all chocolate, sweets and fizzy drinks. I’m doing it because I want to help and make a difference, also a good health kick always does you good. I mean what’s one month without chocolate compared to saving lives from raising money for this worthy cause? It’s a no brainer! Please help me on this. Every single penny helps however big or small. I will post updates on my progress and hope you can join me on this journey! Thank you for all your support. Wish me luck! ❤️</p><p>Message from BHF- The pandemic is the biggest challenge we've faced in our 60 year history.

Unfortunately no one was aware she had this until the day she had multiple cardiac arrests and died shortly after arriving at hospital. So after this happened me and my sisters had regular tests as I’m the disease is hereditary. Not long after having my second child I found I that I have this disease and have had a icd fitted  2 years ago which will not cure anything but should save my life should my heart goes into an arrhythmia or cardiac arrest. Like I said this disease is incurable but the British heart foundation and cardiologist are learning more each day about this disease and hopefully in the future there could be a cure or something that could help. So in memory of my mum and for myself I am going to give up all chocolate, sweets and all fizzy drinks for the whole of March. And as some of you know me giving up a certain fizzy drink will be so hard for me. So please support me. How ever little or large the donation. It will help.

I was 10 years old and my Nan was only 59! When diagnosed she was told the cancer would be cleared in 5 years but sadly it spread into her lymph glands and took her earlier. </p><p>I have so many fond memories of my Nan and the lovely things she would do. She was such a strong, kind, and unconditionally loving lady. One memory that always comes to mind was her stash of fresh soft blueberry bonbons in the old school sweet tubs that she used to keep in the pub kitchen. Whenever me and my family visited she would get the tub out and share them with the children. Another was her fantastic Sunday roasts, nothing beats them to this day, apart from my wife’s and maybe my mums ;) </p><p>When I told my family I wanted to raise money for a charity in memory of my Nan my grandad Peter Wright along with my uncle Jeffrey Wright suggested i raised money for the Marie Curie trust as my Nan would often refer to this trust during her cancer treatment.</p><p>I will be challenging myself to run a minimum of 1 mile a day for 365 days. This will most definitely be a challenge as i have a reasonably physically demanding job, working long days for mostly 6-7 days a week. I also have a large family of 6 including myself so finding the time to run will be difficult. Most of my runs will be commuting to or from work, very early mornings or late evenings. </p><p>Thank you for taking the time to read my ‘short’ story, wish me luck! </p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

We are each going to be running, cycling (ME!) or walking a minimum of 100 miles in March in support of WWF UK. We are all passionate about the planet and want to help in any way we can. It’s also an excuse to get fit during lockdown! WWF UK‘s mission is to stop the degredation of the planet’s natural environment and to build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature. To do this, WWF works with a broad spectrum of partners including governments, industry, and local communities to find solutions to the challenges that face our natural world.<br/></span><br/>With your support and donations you can see just some of the solutions of where the money donated goes towards at: <br/><br/><!--StartFragment--><a href=""https://www.wwf.org.uk/fundraise/where-your-money-goes?fbclid=IwAR0aRLEQLD1xN_hcTPjw_dLiiIslE8Dl8GhldA5BtDGqSs4j-k8kwWdpndM"">Where your money goes | WWF</a><br/></p>",Carter's page,0,0,20,8,0,true,NA,NA,NA,NA,https://images.justgiving.com/image/e71cc593-d4fe-4002-a48d-98d89ac4846a.jpg,https://images.justgiving.com/image/e71cc593-d4fe-4002-a48d-98d89ac4846a.jpg?template=size150x150face,NA,NA,NA,NA,d550b48a-5978-4467-8685-f9594988c87c,100milesinmarch,100 Miles For March,https://www.justgiving.com/cyclingcarter,/cyclingcarter,,,Carter's page,//images.justgiving.com/image/5fb53776-33ee-4e88-9318-e5bf43055018.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,15.547684,Carter Smith,2021-02-25T12:51:59,2344,6545857,2021-02-25T12:48:38,250,12551,5a50e6b4-a6b3-49a5-9aa6-6077b9ffba17,NA,NA,WWF,2344,1081247,2344,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-02-26T07:09:14Z
