Or why not make an afternoon of it and book a table for lunch? Please contact The Horse and Groom on 0118 9332813 to book.<br/><br/>We will also be holding a raffle to raise money for our three chosen charities and I'm hoping that local businesses will be just as generous this year as they were last year.

The BHF has helped halve the number of people dying from heart and circulatory disease in the UK but sadly every day hundreds of people lose their lives. It's only thanks to support from people like us that the BHF can create new treatments and discover new cures. £24 could pay for two hours of research by an early career scientist, but every pound helps so please give what you can to help me hit my target.

We focus on the special things that bring people joy.We also provide important support for carers and families, including bereavement support and counselling.We need to raise £6,150 per day to run the hospice, so every penny counts. Thank you for helping to make sure more people with a terminal illness in and around Belfast, get the care and support they need.
