This Heart Month, our team are committing to walk/jog/run 100km (60 miles) and we'd love to get as many people across the community to join in on the challenge too. 100km might sound a lot, but over a month it works out at roughly 2 miles a day - that's roughly a 20min jog, or a 30 minute walk.

We're asking everyone who takes part to set a target of £100 and help spread the word. If we get 60 people to join the team, then that's £6,000 raised for the BHF's 60th year to go towards life-saving research. If 2020 taught us anything, it's that research works!

Some companies have decided to sponsor employees taking part £1/km up to £100 - an incredible initiative to encourage employees to stay active and take breaks away from their desks. Be creative, feel free to put your own spin on the challenge and have fun!

My son was born with pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect, this meant he had no blood flow to his lungs once his ductus arteriosus closed after birth, he was put on medication instantly to keep this open and at 11 days old went to have a stent placed in that duct but it went wrong and the duct closed and his left lung detached itself, he had no blood flow to his lungs and he was rushed for emergency surgery, it was life or death, we were told to expect the worse because of his tiny little body going through such a major operation, the next day he has slightly improved so the doctors choose to take him off the ventilator, after coming off the ventilator he  showed he wasn't strong enough yet and he crashed right in front of us, he needed cpr, he was placed back on the ventilator and then his right lung collapsed, after a long 7 weeks in hospital after a bumpy recovery due to desats and randomly going blue! Before leaving the hospital we had to learn basic life support as he had a 10% chance of something going wrong until his repair. We finally came home for the first time with our baby boy! Still awaiting a full repair once he was bigger and stronger we stayed at home but we had to monitor his oxygen levels at home and he was on approximately 10 different medications 3 times a day, in and out of hospital with oxygen  levels in the 50-60s, Luca began to struggle, in December we got rushed to Southampton by blue lights after a week in Milton Keynes hospital on oxygen. Luca needed his repair he was so poorly, his left lung wasn't working when he was awake do was only using his Right lung to breathe when he was awake, Luca went for his repair but this didn't go as planned either, Luca seems to fall into the very small percentage of somthing going wrong, unfortunately due to the bypass machine that Luca needed for his surgery it caused a blood clot in his brain and several bleeds in his brain which meant Luca started acting neurological, along side this he had become addicted to morphine as he was on it intravenously for so long while on the ventilator, (he was on the ventilator about a week due to his heart working too hard after the operation. It was trying to do 2 rhythms at once so he had to have his heart 0aced with a pacing box). Now following that surgery Luca went into early stages of heart failure once we got home, so ended up back in Milton Keynes hospital, they've placed him on more medication to help and is now tube fed 90% of the time as he becomes very tired, I am hoping to raise money for research to help more babies like mine keep fighting to get better.</p><p><br/></p><p>Please veiw Luca's gallery to see the gorgeous little boy that makes everyone smile x</p>",My Dechox Fundraising Page,83.75,0,345,460,0,NA,https://images.justgiving.com/image/94b66d8e-e51d-423a-b60b-e901f3ff86b5.jpg,https://images.justgiving.com/image/94b66d8e-e51d-423a-b60b-e901f3ff86b5.jpg?template=size150x150face,"of my son, he has a congenital heart condition",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,f0b38c95-8e29-421c-81e0-4a7b00151c83,Dechox 2021,https://www.justgiving.com/Naomi-Baines1,/Naomi-Baines1,United Kingdom,,My Dechox Fundraising Page,//images.justgiving.com/image/71f21201-8f94-4cb5-b47e-7b3b1e5848e7.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,9.8754425,Naomi Baines,I am not eating chocolate in march for dechox,"of my son, he has a congenital heart condition",2021-01-20T05:36:10,183092,6288571,2021-03-01T00:00:00,75,641389,d58194f9-451d-4077-a36c-306236f8be2d,British Heart Foundation,183092,225971,183092,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-01-21T07:01:41Z

Her sister was only 16.  No family should have to go through that, so I’m dechoxing again this year in his memory. It feels even more significant this year, because I’m the age now that my mum was when she lost her dad. I can’t imagine losing one of my parents yet! With the pandemic money is hard to come by, so anything you can give would mean the world to me. This cause matters so much to me, so I’m giving up all chocolate, sweets, and fizzy drinks throughout March!! (If you know me you’ll know I love jelly sweets more than anything so this isn’t gonna be easy!!) but I’m hoping it will help improve my health and boost my weight loss too! If the money I raise can help just one family not to go through what my mum’s family went through, it’ll be so worth it.
