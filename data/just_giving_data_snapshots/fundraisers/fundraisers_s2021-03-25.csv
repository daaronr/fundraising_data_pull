The CBRE partnership is going to be more important than ever before, to help Macmillan do whatever it takes to support every single person living with cancer.

In our 40th year in the UK we are calling on the support of our employees, their families and our partners to help this wonderful charity who offered unwavering support to a valued employee and friend of GEFCO UK, Denise Panter, and her family during her fight against cancer last year. The past 12 months have been extremely challenging for all and the pandemic has placed restrictions upon what we can do to acknowledge our time in the UK. So, we’d like to brighten up our summer and celebrate this milestone by raising much needed funds for our chosen charity partner and invest further in our employee’s wellbeing by encouraging as many who are willing, to walk the distance with us.</p><p><br/></p><p>My story - </p><p>So as some of you will be aware, in 2020 I faced my own battle with cancer. In September I was diagnosed with testicular cancer and although I seen myself as relatively fit and healthy, with age on my side, I was still left with the worry of wondering how bad it was and what treatment etc I would need. It was then I had the realisation that it can literally happen to any of us and it’s sad that most of us now, know someone who has or has had cancer. Now I was really lucky that mine was found early and after being removed, I only had to go through one count of chemotherapy and touch wood I am now fine, with just regular check ups for the next few years. </p><p><span>I said in 2021 I would like to raise as much money as possible to help support the cause and COVID dependant, I have a few things I would like to do this year.

Living with cancer can be devastating at the best of times, but even harder as a result of the recent pandemic.  At Macmillan, we talk to people affected by cancer every day and for many, issues with money and mental health such as stress and depression, are their biggest worry.

Our partnership focuses on tackling financial hardship and loneliness together, helping Macmillan develop their telephone, online and virtual support services and to help thousands more people with much needed financial and emotional support.

The CBRE partnership is going to be more important than ever before, to help Macmillan do whatever it takes to support every single person living with cancer.

Living with cancer can be devastating at the best of times, but even harder as a result of the recent pandemic.  At Macmillan, we talk to people affected by cancer every day and for many, issues with money and mental health such as stress and depression, are their biggest worry.

Our partnership focuses on tackling financial hardship and loneliness together, helping Macmillan develop their telephone, online and virtual support services and to help thousands more people with much needed financial and emotional support.

The CBRE partnership is going to be more important than ever before, to help Macmillan do whatever it takes to support every single person living with cancer.

Cancer is not going anywhere.  And neither can Macmillan.

Still.... the goal was to push through; a challenge is not a challenge without pushing yourself. </p><p>As someone who could not run the length of herself and had little to no self belief not all that long ago,  I am very proud of my progress in my own health and fitness to date - physically and mentally. If I can inspire just one other person to have the belief in them self that they can feel better, then I’d be very happy. </p><p>I'm raising money for the British Heart Foundation and I'd be so grateful for your support. This charity means a lot personally to me and my family. They have helped halve the number of people dying from heart and circulatory disease in the UK but sadly every day hundreds of people still lose their lives. </p><p>Every pound helps towards creating new treatments and discovering new cures, so please give what you can to help me hit my target.

During this time I personally have found their information services incredibly helpful and I have also used their Cardiac Nurse Phone line whom I have found most knowledgeable. During lockdown I have also re-visited their DVD for Cardiac Rehab which has been most beneficial. </p><p>This year BHF are celebrating 60 years of life saving research. My understanding is that in cases like mine (ie I had my SCA in Mile 25 of a Trail Marathon and had CPR administered by fellow runners, and a recent study in Warwick showed that about 5 in a 100 people who have an OOH SCA arrive at Hospital alive and of those many will struggle to make it out of Hospital without some issues as the brain will have been starved of oxygen whilst &#34;down&#34; (ie unconscious) . About 50% die as there are no bystanders and many of the others as the bystanders don't know what to do. Hence I went along to a series of CPR Training sessions with BHF &amp; BBC Radio Suffolk to say you can save a life by knowing how to do CPR. My blog of my journey has been reproduced in Paul Swindell's book, Life after Sudden Cardiac Arrest. I will re-tell sections on facebook for those interested.</p><p>As we gradually ease out of lockdown, and begin to enjoy some Spring sunshine, this is the perfect time to focus on improving our health and wellbeing.

I’m raising money for the British Heart Foundation and would be very grateful for your support. <br/>Our journey began over 15 years ago when my father in law Gus had his first heart attack age 67. <br/>He had to retire from an active working life in forestry, now on medication and leading a more sedentary life, but every day was a blessing for us all. <br/><br/>Over the next 14 years, there were a few smaller heart attacks but he recovered with medication and determination and enough to keep his hand in on the occasional woodworking project. <br/><br/>September 2020 Gus took a turn for the worst. His failing heart unable to function well enough and fluid was building up almost ‘drowning him from the inside out’<br/>The family were called as his heart went into uncontrollable tachycardia which meant it could have given up at any moment. <br/>He was treated in hospital over the next month but due to covid restrictions only Violet, my mother in law was allowed to visit. <br/>The separation from home and his family was taking it’s toll on Gus. <br/><br/>Finally he was stabilised enough to be discharged back home to the care of his family as no further treatment would be successful. <br/><br/>As we knew we were on borrowed time we formed a ‘Macdonald bubble’ forsaking allowable interactions with other family &amp; friends to enable we kept Gus safe. This sacrifice allowed us to spend as much time enjoying, loving and caring for him and supporting Vi who had taken on the role as his full time carer. <br/><br/>Gus &amp; Vi had been married 58 years. She was the most patient and dedicated carer, tending tirelessly to his every need, day and night. <br/><br/>His face light up every time a member of the family appeared, especially the grandkids &amp; great grandkids. <br/><br/>We were encouraged with odd days he was able to make soup &amp; bake almost thinking our time together might be extended. Sadly taking us all by surprise early February Gus became very poorly. <br/>Knowing the end was near the family stayed by his side for 4 days, loving and caring for him, holding his hand and at times each other up too. <br/><br/>The end was peaceful surrounded by his loving family, where he wanted to be. <br/><br/>If our donations can help save or prolong someone’s life so their family can hold on to a loved one for a bit longer that would be priceless. <br/><br/>Thank you for your kindness <br/><br/>Liz ♥️<br/></p>",NA,NA,Liz is Shaving her head,177.50,0,1265,127,0,NA,If I can raise a grand I’ll shave my head because We lost the head of the Macdonald clan,If I can raise a grand I’ll shave my head,We lost the head of the Macdonald clan,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Shaving my head ,https://www.justgiving.com/Liz-Macdonald67,/Liz-Macdonald67,United Kingdom,,Liz is Shaving her head,//images.justgiving.com/image/6b6f1f76-14f8-4f93-9052-688930ba260a.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,22.040194,Liz  Macdonald ,2021-03-19T20:42:46,183092,6591002,2021-03-19T20:42:46,1000,641389,bdfa86a2-0c86-4542-8a15-2b741db1efe7,If I can raise a grand I’ll shave my head,We lost the head of the Macdonald clan,British Heart Foundation,183092,225971,183092,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-03-25T07:16:01Z

The care and support I have received has been brilliant and the work performed by the BHF has had a direct impact on that, so in the very least this is an opportunity to give something back. To mark the 60th birthday of the BHF, on April 25th I will be cycling 60 miles around Suffolk and am looking for sponsorship.

As you know I got Flynn in November of last year and I cant explain how much he has changed my life. It’s not just the practical/obvious things he has helped with like walking to school, walking at night, shopping and the list could go on. He has also helped me walk around the shops with a little less anxiety, a little less embarrassed about myself and I now am learning to walk with my head held high because of him. I also had the BEST couch I could of ever asked for, so this fundraising isn’t just for the dogs its also for the trainers who put their time into these incredible dogs, its for the boarders that open there homes to the dogs. So please, I know I have asked you before but I need your help again. I am planning to do 10,000 steps with Flynn and raise as much as possible. Thank you for taking your time to read this story. This is just the beginning for me and Flynn. </p><p><span> Just £95 could buy a training school kit for one guide dog trainer who will teach pups the special skills they need as fully qualified guide dog.

Your small steps will help Guide Dogs make giant leaps. Just one week of stepping can make a difference to the life of children and adults living with sight loss. Raise over £50 (£25 for children) and well replace those worn out socks with a brand-new Guide Dogs pair designed by an international fashion icon!

How your funds will change lives...

-	£50 could pay for fun, tactile activities to help children co-ordinate their muscles and movements.

-	£96 could pay for an eye test each for two guide dogs in training

-	£116 could buy a Training School Kit for one of our guide dog trainers who will teach pups the specialist skills they need as fully qualified guide dogs.

-	£710 could buy a Birthing Kit containing all the essential equipment for a guide dog mum to safely deliver her puppies.

Its thanks to people like you that we can continue to provide life-changing services. So, a huge thank you and lots of luck for your challenge!

Thankfully I have a few more weeks to change that. </p><p><span>3 days ago, in a moment of realisation that I will be turning 30 on the 1st of April, I decided it would be awesome to run my first Marathon. Yes, a whole 26.2 miles with no crowd to cheer me on, no medal waiting for me at the finish line and very little time to train. (For full disclosure - I run a couple of times a week, 10km being a solid Saturday. So certainly not starting from scratch!)</span></p><p><span>I'll be running from my home in East London to Hyde Park, with a few detours along the way. 26.2 miles / 42.2 km. </span><br/></p><p>While I'm embarking on this mad idea, I think it would be incredible to raise some money for a cause that's very close to my heart. Some of you may not know, but I spent a number of years being looked after by the incredible people at Great Ormond Street Hospital as a child. Not only have I come out of that period in my life stronger and healthier, but I also have some fond memories of a pretty rubbish time in my life.  </p><p>Every single day GOSH care for thousands of kids from all over the world.

For any parent, it is a worrying time when your child needs hospital treatment. But if your child is seriously ill, in the middle of a pandemic, this is even more daunting. 

With infection control restrictions on parents staying with their children, worry around travelling safely to and from hospital and being treated by staff in protective clothing, what is already a stressful time is even more challenging.

Your support could help fund services like the hospitals incredible Play team, Social Work Service and multi-faith chaplaincy team, as well as funding family accommodation so mums and dads stay near their children.

The Hospice is often very different from what people expect  it is a warm, friendly space with beautiful gardens, delicious home-cooked food and personalised care. Every person is treated as an individual and helped to reach their goals and fulfil their wishes. A team of nurses, doctors, social workers, physiotherapists, chaplains, bereavement counsellors and pharmacists work together, putting every person at the centre of their care.

Throughout Covid-19 Glasgow Hospice teams have been working around the clock to continue supporting local people. Death, dying and bereavement is at the forefront of peoples minds and Marie Curie knows what a difference the right care at the end of life can make.

They cant do any of this without your support. Thank you for your generous donation which supports the Glasgow Hospice and Marie Curie across the UK.

She wasn't at Marie Curie for long, but I still remember the care she received when she was so ill.</p><p><b><u>SO</u></b> I have decided to get my long mop cut off. Not shaved as my Sis will kill me for being a bald bridesmaid, but a very short style. It's taken me 4 years to get my hair this length, so it's a big step for me. If you are able to support and sponsor me it would be very much appreciated. I will also be donating my actual hair to the Little Princess Trust.</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

Just £30 could provide a full kit to protect a health-worker on the frontline, including gloves, masks and coveralls, while just £43 could help provide 1,680 pairs of disposable gloves for health workers.The impact of a large-scale outbreak of coronavirus on children, especially poor and vulnerable children, has been immense. Children are at risk from the disease, but also from the disruption to health and education services, impacts on caregivers, and separation from family members.Unicef has been working closely with governments and the World Health Organization (WHO) since the start of the coronavirus outbreak and will continue to do so with help from donations.
