I am running the 2021 Edinburgh Marathon for Macmillan Cancer Support in order to raise as much money as possible.They are a fantastic Charity and I would be so grateful if you could take the time to sponsor me to help the cause and to motivate me in my training!There are around 367,000 new cancer cases in the UK every year, that's around 1,000 every day (2015-2017). In females in the UK, there were more than 179,000 new cancer cases in 2017. In males in the UK, there were around 187,000 new cancer cases in 2017. Every two minutes someone in the UK is diagnosed with cancer.By giving to great charities such as Macmillan we can help in the fight against cancer by raising awareness and money so that a cure can be found sooner.This race will be run in memory of my Grandma, Liz, who unfortunately passed away in 2017 due to cancer.Any donation no matter big or small would mean a huge amount to me and the cause, thank you all.

The BHF has helped halve the number of people dying from heart and circulatory disease in the UK but sadly every day hundreds of people lose their lives. It's only thanks to support from people like us that the BHF can create new treatments and discover new cures. £24 could pay for two hours of research by an early career scientist, but every pound helps so please give what you can to help me hit my target. Thanks! </p><p>I sadly lost my dad to this horrible heart disease but now the work of the BHF are helping to save my mum’s life.  Please give generously and thanks in advance for all your support. </p>",Sheena's Walk the decks  page,0,0,40,8,0,https://images.justgiving.com/image/2c9d34b0-4523-40d3-a914-9887ee1f5a85.jpg,https://images.justgiving.com/image/2c9d34b0-4523-40d3-a914-9887ee1f5a85.jpg?template=size150x150face,I am walking the decks of Britannia,I am walking the decks of Britannia,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Walk the decks ,https://www.justgiving.com/Walk-the-decks,/Walk-the-decks,United Kingdom,,Sheena's Walk the decks  page,//images.justgiving.com/image/trainer-no-branding_web.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true&sourcepath=Stock,Fundraiser,23.217304,Sheena Matthams,2020-09-30T11:10:07,183092,6250308,2020-10-01T00:00:00,500,641389,f0f9bc09-9407-4868-9f5d-496245744bbd,I am walking the decks of Britannia,NA,British Heart Foundation,183092,225971,183092,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2020-10-01T08:16:47Z
