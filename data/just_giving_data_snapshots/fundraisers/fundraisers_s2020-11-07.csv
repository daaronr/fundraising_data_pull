During these difficult COVID times, it's so important to us to be giving something back to our wider community and society in general, and as such our employees have committed to this challenge with great determination in the hope that we can really make a difference. Unfortunately, there are very few of us who have not been touched by heart or circulatory disease, stroke, dementia, diabetes within our own families/friend's circle. We hope you will be able to support us to raise some much needed funds for the BHF - this would mean so much to all of us. Every little counts and we greatly appreciate it! Our teams comprise 5 climbers per team, and every team has committed to achieve the Everest virtual climb within a 4 week period.

As the second lock down approached , I was keen to do something to motivate me to make a positive difference in peoples lives. Like many, I found the first lock down tough , I felt as if I was getting myself into bad habits and unhealthy mindsets; contributing negatively on my mental and physical health. Feeling anxious and down, as well as overindulging in takeaways and alcohol. This time round i want it to be different, therefore, I thought there was no better motivation to stay mentally and physically healthy than fundraising for a charity which is close to my heart. Cancer Research has helped improve and save lives of many people including the lives of some of my close family members. Cancer is a sensitive subject for many people and i hope by your donations it could help research progress and one day find a cure to this horrible disease. I think cancer affects us all, whether thats seeing a stranger suffering, a friend, work colleague or a family member. Its something which reminds us that life is valuable and a time where it brings all humans together.</span><br style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);""/><br style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);""/><span style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);float: none;"">I will be running 25 miles each week over 4 weeks and will be posting updates on here.

Its a warm and welcoming place where we give expert care to people with a terminal illness, and their loved ones, every day of the year. 

Our hospice team includes doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, social workers and many more, and is supported by over 200 volunteers  who play a vital role in the running of the hospice.

We have a 24-bed in-patient unit, where relatives and friends can visit any time of the day or night, and stay with their loved ones if they wish.

Our out-patient unit offers clinics, therapies and group sessions  and freshly cooked lunches made by our chefs. We also support carers and families, including children, with practical advice, counselling and bereavement support groups.

We need to raise £9,600 per day to run the hospice, so every penny counts. Thank you for helping to make sure more people with a terminal illness in Solihull get the care and support they need.
