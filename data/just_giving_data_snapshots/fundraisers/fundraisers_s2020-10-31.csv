A combination of multiple lockdowns and a busy day job has meant that I haven't managed to cut my hair in over a year. 

As it turns out my circumstances have changed dramatically in that time and I have seen the scale of suffering due to mental illness and the saddening impacts of delayed cancer care. 

In my work as a Jr Dr, I have held the hands of patients weeping from the loneliness of isolation, and from very close family members with beautiful hearts but lost and broken minds. I have seen far too many young and old lives taken by the invisible illness. MIND has been a constant source of guidance and reliance clinically and personally and they do it completely free. 

Secondly, I have found myself disheartened and emotionally flawed on numerous occasions at the injustice of cancer.

When Lockdown started I decided to exercise by walking around a circuit in the house.<br/>When my daughter in law, Andrea, told me that she was taking up a Club Walking Challenge I thought that I would do the same.<br/>I entered the Wild Atlantic Challenge (a virtual walk along the coast of Donegal which has particular meaning for me as it was where my late wife Angela was born and grew up).  The challenge<span> was to complete 500km within three months starting on 1 June and I completed the challenge in 41 days by walking entirely indoors.

He was in the process of organising a second Challenge and he asked whether I would be the Ambassador for the Wild Atlantic Winter Challenge which was more ambitious in that participants could choose from four different distances over a period of four months commencing 1 October 2020.</p><p>I accepted the position of Ambassador and committed to walk the 500 mile challenge which I am now 1 month underway with.</p><p>Prompted by a number of comments and suggestions from friends, this time I am going to walk for a Charity, specifically, CANCER RESEARCH and for the following reasons;<br/>For many years I have carried the memory of my brother and his family.<br/>Early in their marriage they lost a baby son to Cancer of the Bladder.  Later, in her forties, his wife died from Breast Cancer and within a year of retirement he himself died from Cancer of the Bowel. I had the sad experience of sitting next to him in hospital when his Consultant told him that he had two weeks to live.<br/>Currently I have a niece who has recovered from Cancer and I know of two friends who are fighting Cancer. They are not yet confirmed to be in the clear, but one anticipates a return to work in a month’s time after successful treatment undertaken since the beginning of Lockdown.</p><p>It seems to me that the Battle against Cancer is being won, if maybe slowly, and additional funding for Research would enable more work to be undertaken.<br/>I started my new Challenge on 1 October.   Would you please consider Sponsoring  me for CANCER RESEARCH on my journey, so that together we may help those who are suffering now and hopefully reduce the spread of this disease in the future.</p><p><span>Thanks for taking the time to visit my JustGiving page and please accept my thanks in anticipation!</span><br/></p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.
