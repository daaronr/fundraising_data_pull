Emma’s dad was diagnosed with bladder cancer after having no symptoms back in 2019. He underwent radiotherapy and spent the next 12 months recovering overcoming several complications along the way. Thankfully he is doing well and is having his regular checks. At the start of December my brother Graham began to pass blood in his urine. After a biopsy we were given the news just after Christmas that he has aggressive bladder cancer and would need surgery to fully remove his bladder changing his life forever. Around the same time Graham’s mother-in-law discovered a lump on her neck. Following a biopsy she has now been told she has thyroid cancer after battling the same disease 30 years ago. She will need to undergo surgery to have her thyroid removed and then there will be intensive treatment to follow.</p><p>So instead of wallowing and thinking life isn’t fair I have decided to embark on a 28 day challenge to not only push myself physically and mentally but also to hopefully raise money for MacMillan cancer whose tireless research and support work means that people are able to beat cancer.</p><p>I will be charting my progress on a daily basis  for you all to see and maybe have a giggle at.</p><p>Any donation that you can make no matter how big or small would be so appreciated and will help MacMillan continue with their outstanding work.</p><p>Thank you </p><p>John </p>,Johns  February Fitness Challenge,12.50,0,50,10,0,I’m planing to complete 350k in February because 3 family members have been affected,I’m planing to complete 350k in February,3 family members have been affected,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,John’s February Fitness Challenge ,https://www.justgiving.com/John-Myres,/John-Myres,United Kingdom,,Johns  February Fitness Challenge,//images.justgiving.com/image/0e3673c5-6e8d-4ceb-8c0e-0d3ac69bfc8b.png?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,14.791896,John Myres,I’m planing to complete 350k in February,3 family members have been affected,2021-01-22T14:09:51,2116,6475123,2021-02-01T00:00:00,500,13507,b60c4d08-bd53-421e-8c73-1f21be70e14c,Macmillan Cancer Support,2116,261017,2116,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-01-23T07:01:32Z

This Heart Month, our team are committing to walk/jog/run 100km (60 miles) and we'd love to get as many people across the community to join in on the challenge too. 100km might sound a lot, but over a month it works out at roughly 2 miles a day - that's roughly a 20min jog, or a 30 minute walk.

We're asking everyone who takes part to set a target of £100 and help spread the word. If we get 60 people to join the team, then that's £6,000 raised for the BHF's 60th year to go towards life-saving research. If 2020 taught us anything, it's that research works!

Some companies have decided to sponsor employees taking part £1/km up to £100 - an incredible initiative to encourage employees to stay active and take breaks away from their desks. Be creative, feel free to put your own spin on the challenge and have fun!

It was the most heartbreaking news I've ever had. I was given information leaflets provided by the British Heart Foundation which explained things and answered lots of questions. He had 3 open heart operations by the time he was 4 weeks old. He has had a long journey to recovery but he is doing well at the moment. He is now 6 months old and results of a recent ct scan have showed there is still a narrowing in the artery which leads to his lungs.</p><p>I am supporting the British Heart Foundation because I want to do something to say thank you for their help when we needed it. I hope that if we need further help later down the line, they will be there for us. But not just for us, but to help other families going through similar experiences.</p><p>I am a huge lover of chocolate and to go a full month without any will be extremely difficult, not to mention adding no sweets or fizzy drinks on top! Help motivate me and donate anything you can, even if its only 50p! The higher I see the donations going, the more motivated I will be to keep going to the end of the month!</p><p>Please share this with all of your friends and family to help me raise as much money as possible for the British Heart Foundation.</p><p>Thank you everyone</p><p>Clare </p>",My Dechox Fundraising Page,0,0,0,0,0,I am raising money because I want to give something back for Jasper.,I am raising money,I want to give something back for Jasper.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,f0b38c95-8e29-421c-81e0-4a7b00151c83,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Dechox 2021,https://www.justgiving.com/Baby-Jaspers-Future,/Baby-Jaspers-Future,United Kingdom,,My Dechox Fundraising Page,//images.justgiving.com/image/dc780b50-34fb-4169-af98-d5b2a9b39d70.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,9.871618,Clare  Race,I am raising money,I want to give something back for Jasper.,2021-01-22T12:07:29,183092,6288571,2021-03-01T00:00:00,100,641389,922ace4e-cd76-4a1f-bfcd-985b37800fea,British Heart Foundation,183092,225971,183092,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-01-23T07:01:32Z
