So it's the most efficient way to donate - saving time and cutting costs for the charity.</p><p>In 2015, when I was 20 weeks pregnant with my 3rd child, we found out that there was an issue with one of the baby's kidneys. At the time, we knew only that it was dilated, nothing else. </p><p>Fast forward 20 weeks of questions, tests and huge anxiety on our part. Our daughter, Tess, was born with a complicated duplex kidney. Basically, the top part of Tess' right kidney was happily making urine but couldn't drain because it's ureter was blocked. Tess was in pain, she cried, constantly, no medicine helped her and we were struggling to cope with the lack of support we felt we had.</p><p>When Tess was 4 months old, we went to Great Ormond Street Hospital for Tess to undergo tests on her kidney. We then met Professor Cuckow. He explained to us that Tess needed to undergo surgery to remove her kidney. He made us feel instantly better - he told us that it was important it was done quickly but that she would recover and be well. </p><p>Shortly after this meeting, Professor Cuckow and his team operated on Tess, they managed to save the bottom half of her kidney. One of his doctors told us in recovery, that Tess' kidney had swollen to the size of an orange, taking up a huge part of her abdomen and close to blocking her bladder completely.</p><p>We stayed for a week under Great Ormond Street's care. Every single person we met during that time had a huge impact on us, we will be forever grateful.</p><p>Tess is now almost 5. She no longer needs medication. The only lasting issue is her need to stay hydrated as she is prone to infection. We have one more check up with the team at Great Ormond Street before we are signed off - although we were reassured at our last appointment that, although we're signed off, they will always be there for Tess.</p><p>Tess is a healthy, happy and clever girl, we are so proud of her. She is also very proud of her 'rainbow scar' (her words!) as are we. </p><p>Running 31 miles in January will be a fair challenge for me. I'll update my social media to keep track of how I'm getting on. Any pennies you can spare to support me...or, more importantly, Great Ormond Street, are much appreciated. </p>",Joanna's page,0,0,0,0,0,true,I am taking part in Running Off Christmas. because I'd like to give something back.,I am taking part in Running Off Christmas.,I'd like to give something back.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Running off Christmas 2021,https://www.justgiving.com/Joanna-Kerslake,/Joanna-Kerslake,United Kingdom,,Joanna's page,//images.justgiving.com/image/591f7fd0-7ed2-40d4-b2c8-c16563bc6a3a.png?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,20.737755,Joanna Kerslake,I am taking part in Running Off Christmas.,I'd like to give something back.,2020-12-20T18:55:29,254,6270851,2021-01-01T00:00:00,0,12057,4d9b3b70-8b70-4562-b811-20f943790b8b,Great Ormond Street Hospital,254,1160024,254,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2020-12-21T06:18:11Z
