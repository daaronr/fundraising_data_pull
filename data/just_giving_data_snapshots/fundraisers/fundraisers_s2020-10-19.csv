Dr Thompson did a fantastic job removing the cyst but it didn’t come without its worries and it’s sadness that this was happening to our baby boy. We left hospital a week later, just in time for him to be 1 month old but he got an infection... it eventually cleared up and then from there on things were plain sailing and now nearly two years later our beautiful, perfect, happy baby boy is talking, running and eating for England. </p><p>On his 2nd birthday we are planning to do a sponsored walk around Whitlingham Broads to show how far he has come from a boy who might not have been able to walk to doing all he can now and to thank all the people that looked after our boy and gave him the life he deserves and gave us our ray of sunshine back. </p><p>Thankyou to everyone for saying thanks to them with us.</p><p>Love Amy, Harry &amp; Elijah &#128153;&#128153;</p>",Elijahs Whitlingham Walk,11.25,0,102,29,0,true,NA,https://images.justgiving.com/image/b8443c94-09dd-430b-9d6b-9701606da9ec.jpg,https://images.justgiving.com/image/b8443c94-09dd-430b-9d6b-9701606da9ec.jpg?template=size150x150face,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Me and Elijah are going to be doing a walk because they helped give Elijah a better quality of life.,Me and Elijah are going to be doing a walk,they helped give Elijah a better quality of life.,NA,Elijah’s Whitlingham Walk,https://www.justgiving.com/elijahswalk,/elijahswalk,United Kingdom,,Elijahs Whitlingham Walk,//images.justgiving.com/image/e5de129a-ff4a-4b6b-bec0-f63bc75745ca.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,12.004179,Amy Green,Me and Elijah are going to be doing a walk,they helped give Elijah a better quality of life.,2020-10-18T09:59:49,254,6285617,2021-01-11T00:00:00,350,12057,a064df24-12b3-483c-887e-8f465cacee88,Great Ormond Street Hospital,254,1160024,254,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2020-10-19T05:11:55Z
