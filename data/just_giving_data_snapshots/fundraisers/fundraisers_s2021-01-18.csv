As many of you know I am a total sugar addict!  This will be testing for me, but I am more than willing to go throu the hardship  to beat heart diseases.  Recently we lost our grandmother to a heart related incident. Anyone who knew my nan would know how much of a warm, caring and affection women she was. This family has hit family and friends quite hard. Any donations in her name would be an honor to her family and friends. And hopefully (touch wood) some day we will beat heart disease &#128170;&#128170;&#128170;</p>",My Dechox Fundraising Page,0,0,0,0,0,In honuor of my family members,NA,NA,https://images.justgiving.com/image/9f023d13-7e68-4826-8369-c3c070ed5e58.jpg,https://images.justgiving.com/image/9f023d13-7e68-4826-8369-c3c070ed5e58.jpg?template=size150x150face,f0b38c95-8e29-421c-81e0-4a7b00151c83,NA,NA,NA,Dechox 2021,https://www.justgiving.com/Maisey-Pritchard,/Maisey-Pritchard,United Kingdom,,My Dechox Fundraising Page,//images.justgiving.com/image/dc780b50-34fb-4169-af98-d5b2a9b39d70.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,20.15949,Maisey Pritchard,Raising money for the British heart foundation,In honuor of my family members,2021-01-17T21:08:44,183092,6288571,2021-03-01T00:00:00,75,641389,23d5f7d5-32f8-4d57-8acc-fce3ad296169,British Heart Foundation,183092,225971,183092,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-01-18T07:02:18Z

We then changed to the Jurassic Coast Challenge for September 2020 but sadly this too was cancelled. And so we're trying again in the hope that our event in May - virus permitting - will get the go ahead. Fingers crossed!<br/></p><p>We're truly grateful to all those (22 supporters in total who are listed in our original GOSH JustGiving page: https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising-edit/teampurbrun) who donated in 2020 even though we didn't set off and would like to assure you that the incredible sum of £770 raised as part of our £1,000 target has been put to good use. It has ensured that Great Ormond Street Hospital during these most challenging of times has been able to continue its great work and, more importantly for our family, has continued to treat, support and care for our two &#34;junior&#34; members, now aged 9 and 7. They thankfully continue to grow, flourish and enjoy life. <br/></p><p>Anyway to help get us started on a training regime we are taking part in a virtual challenge, namely, walking the Welsh Coastal Path, Chepstow to Chester, 870 miles!!! We have a year to complete this particular challenge and are accompanied by Zo<span>ë</span>, Pete's daughter, and Evelyn, our 1 year old granddaughter, who are making sure we keep to a strict regime. We are using it as a means to clock up the mileage and stamina we'll need to do the 26.2 miles we'll be doing from Weymouth to Bridport on Sunday 16 May 2021. <br/></p><p>We'll let you know how we progress, you can follow us here: https://www.endtoend.run/map-wcp3/ by typing 'Pete Browne' into the 'search for names' box, we're Bib number 39228 .....

We also enjoyed spending time with her and Jim at their home, eating the delicious food she had cooked and having the essential 6pm sherry.

As some of you may be aware, Gran overcame breast cancer when she was younger and ever since has been a strong supporter of Cancer Research UK, she made regular donations and also volunteered in one of their stores for several years.

The Sussexman triathlon or Lockdown Ironman was born.<br/><br/>The idea is simple, and Ironman distance triathlon (3.8k swim, 112 mile cycle, 26 mile run) starting in the sea at Brighton, riding over the South Downs, and then a marathon from Hampton court in central London and finishing at Big Ben.<br/><br/>Of course, it’s all got to be socially distanced,  so I’ll be doing it solo, but supported through the different stages by friends from Mid Sussex Triathlon Club, some swimming, others cycling and some running.  The race is scheduled for Saturday 19th June.<br/><br/>The plan is to raise a little money along the way.  I will be fundraising for the RLNI - lifeboats.  We all expect them to ‘just be there’ when we get into trouble like all the other emergency services, but they are charity made up of volunteers and facing all the same COVID challenges.  The more crazy people like me who take to sea swimming the more they are going to be in demand, so I would like to give something back.
