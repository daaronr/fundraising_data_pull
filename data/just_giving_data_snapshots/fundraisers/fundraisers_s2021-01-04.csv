At 3 months old due to a routine appointment they were found in which time he was struggling for breath and unable to feed normally. After 2 years of constant hospital admissions and ending in 2 heart operations one being open heart surgery he finally started to live a normal life. I would like to give back as during our stays in London Royal Brompton we were given help and support in many different ways. I would like more training to be given and more high tech scanners used during ultrasounds in pregnancy to ensure these heart conditions aren't missed. Please give as much as you can, it really is a amazing charity that have struggled during the pandemic to raise vital funds ❤ I am skydiving in memory of my dear friend Daisy who we sadly lost due to a skydiving accident. Its taken me many years to gain the courage to do this.

It was the scariest moment of our lives and we were very close to losing her. My brother, Chris, distributed life-saving CPR to our mum, having been taught it at Cadets. The British Heart Foundation campaign tirelessly for more education on CPR techniques, and in our case, had my brother not been there at the time, things may not have turned out as well as they did for us. We are so fortunate that our mum made a miraculous full recovery from the cardiac arrest. Our family and our mum individually were supported greatly by the BHF following the event and we are huge advocates of their work. </p><p>We would be so grateful if you are able to donate money for this amazing cause no matter how small; we really appreciate it! </p><p>The BHF has helped halve the number of people dying from heart and circulatory disease in the UK but sadly every day hundreds of people lose their lives. It's only thanks to support from people like you that the BHF can create new treatments and discover new cures.

Keeping a very poorly baby alive for 9 days before he received his first open heart surgery and then his second at 6 months old. <br /><br />Unfortunately Charlie’s heart cannot be fixed and therefore he will need more heart surgeries in the coming years and require the ongoing care from GOSH for the rest of his life. <br /><br />We will forever be grateful to all of the staff at GOSH for giving us the time with our amazing little man that was very nearly taken away from us.

This is something that really hit home last year when my mum and auntie jaxs were diagnosed.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span><br/><br/>In January Jaxs was told she had incurable brain tumour. Anyone that knew my auntie will know what an incredibly strong and determined lady she was, so it will be no surprise that even after hearing such devastating news, she rolled up her sleeves, dug in her heels and fought as hard as she could to fight this awful disease. Unfortunately this fight was one that couldn’t be won and after just 3 months her battle came to an end passing away on the 5 April.<br/><br/>Just 5 months after losing jaxs, mum was diagnosed with breast cancer. Although having to go through intense treatment, the prognosis is positive and she is on her way to sticking two fingers up at cancer!<br/><br/>We want to contribute to Cancer Research with the hope that one day no one will have to go through this. This is why we will be dusting off our walking boots and trying our best to raise as much money as possible for a great cause. So whether you can spare pennies or pounds, it will go to a fantastic cause and make a real difference.
