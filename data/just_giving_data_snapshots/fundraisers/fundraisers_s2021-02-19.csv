It‚Äôs from knowing Roger (and his lovely wife Sue, and my lovely wife Cassie) that my enthusiasm for the outdoors first developed, spending many weekends together in the Peak District on long hikes getting lost (but never admitting it) and then afterward having a laugh over cake and extra-large lattes. Roger would've been the first person out on the Dales with me, and I know he'll be there in spirit.¬†<br/><br/>I could write so much more about this remarkable man; about how he led Fulham FC to promotion in 1982 (a central defender who scored 12 goals in a single season!!), about his life after football helping young offenders rehabilitate, or that time he miraculously trained the most unruly Weimaraner-ever (Phoebe) to wipe her feet on the door mat‚Ä¶.. but if I started writing more I may never stop.¬†<br/><span><br/></span><span>Roger loved life and yet he died aged only 58. He touched so many people in his short time and if anyone deserved a long and happy retirement surrounded by the family he held so dear it was Roger. But cancer doesn‚Äôt care who you are, nor what you‚Äôve done, nor how loved you are.¬†<br/></span><span><br/>By raising money in Roger's name for Macmillan Cancer Support, I hope to help in some small way all the people who have, will be or are affected by this most brutal disease.<br/></span><span><br/>Thanks,¬†<br/></span><span><br/>Pete<br/></span><span><br/>P.S. I am thankful everyday for having known Roger. He made me a better person and welcomed me into a family I am proud to be part of.

We work for Which? and we are fundraising for the British Heart Foundation in memory of our friend and colleague Sarah Price, who passed away suddenly last year at the age of 39. 

Sarah was a wonderful person; she excelled in her job but was also a committed team-player, going to great lengths to help her team members day-in, day-out. She was a brilliant friend: funny and kind, someone who always made time for everyone she encountered.

We continue to miss her greatly. 

Sarah was a big fan of Welsh rugby and so we are planning to run, walk or cycle a combined distance that will stretch from our Bristol office, where Sarah worked, to the Principality Stadium in Cardiff and back again, which is around 86 miles in total. We plan to do this over the weekend of 27 - 28 February 2021, being the weekend closest to both St. David's Day and Sarah's 5-year anniversary since she started at Which?.

Each participant will undertake 5km, either walking, running or cycling, to help us get to the total distance. 

The BHF has helped halve the number of people dying from heart and circulatory disease in the UK but sadly every day hundreds of people lose their lives. It's only thanks to donations that the BHF can create new treatments and discover new cures. ¬£24 could pay for two hours of research by an early career scientist, but every pound helps so please give what you can to help us hit our target.

The daffodil is synonymous with the Marie Curie Great Daffodil Appeal, manned each year by volunteers with money tins, to whom many of you generously donate your cash in exchange for the yellow daffodil, a symbol of light and hope for those requiring Marie Curie nursing in their final weeks of life.¬†</p><p>This year, it is with a heavy heart that the decision was made to cancel the usual way of collecting during the appeal due to the pandemic, but this does not mean that the beacon of light or hope has disappeared, or that Marie Curie will stop caring for the terminally ill. The yellow daffodil will still bloom regardless and the Wey Valley Marie Curie Committee have decided to bring the Great Daffodil Appeal to you.</p><p><b>Would you like to be able to put a smile on 100 people‚Äôs faces by either sponsoring or taking part in a 10-mile walk? During the week of 16<sup>th</sup> ‚Äì 23<sup>rd</sup> March, we are asking you to metaphorically<br/>wear your daffodil with pride by either taking part in a 10-mile walk, whether alone, with your bubble or socially distanced with one other person from outside your bubble, or to sponsor someone who is undertaking the 10 miles on foot.¬†</b></p><p><b>All money raised will go directly to Marie Curie to help fund home nursing end of life care for any patient who needs it for any terminal illness that they may have. Our walking week will culminate in a minute‚Äôs silence for the National Day of Reflection on 23<sup>rd</sup> March.</b></p><p><b>You can make a donation to this just giving page or create your own sponsorship page from our team page. If you have any questions or problems then email our community fundraiser Emma via emmalouise.dolman@mariecurie.org.uk</b></p><p>Sadly, terminal illness still continues throughout this pandemic, and unfortunately charitable activities have not been able to take place in the same way over the past year. But we still need your help and we still need to fund nursing care costs of ¬£20 an hour to those who are in desperate need for it. 10 miles could bring 100 smiles to those who are touched by your generous fundraising.¬†</p><p>Thank you for keeping the daffodil in bloom and helping to raise 100 smiles for those who are in need. </p><p><b>Send us a picture of your walk so that we can post it below!!!

Its a warm and welcoming place where we give expert care to people with a terminal illness, and their loved ones, every day of the year. 

Our hospice team includes doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, social workers and many more, and is supported by over 200 volunteers  who play a vital role in the running of the hospice.

We have a 24-bed in-patient unit, where relatives and friends can visit any time of the day or night, and stay with their loved ones if they wish.

Our out-patient unit offers clinics, therapies and group sessions  and freshly cooked lunches made by our chefs. We also support carers and families, including children, with practical advice, counselling and bereavement support groups.

We need to raise ¬£9,600 per day to run the hospice, so every penny counts. Thank you for helping to make sure more people with a terminal illness in Solihull get the care and support they need.
