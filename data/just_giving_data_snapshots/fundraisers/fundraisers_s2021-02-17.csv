And in lockdown, I've resorted to spending around £5 a day on the stuff again. That's a lot of chocolate, fat, sugar and cholesterol to put inside one body.

The BHF has helped halve the number of people dying from heart and circulatory disease in the UK but sadly every day hundreds of people lose their lives. It's only thanks to support from people like us that the BHF can create new treatments and discover new cures. £24 could pay for two hours of research by an early career scientist, but every pound helps so please give what you can to help me hit my target!

I'm raising money for the British Heart Foundation and I'd be so grateful for your support. Last year my mum had a mild heart attack and it really frightened me as we have lost my grandparents, auntie and cousin to heart attacks. 2020 saw my mum become a Nannie again to two beautiful little girls and I want my mum to be around to see them grow up and share memories with them. I have a massive sweet tooth and literally just live off sugar, sweets chocolate biscuits and Pepsi max so de-choccin in March is a huge challenge for me and anyone who knows me, knows this will be hard. So aswell as challenging myself and in an attempt to ditch sugar it would be brilliant if I could also raise some Money for such a brilliant charity.The BHF has helped halve the number of people dying from heart and circulatory disease in the UK but sadly every day hundreds of people lose their lives. It's only thanks to support from people like us that the BHF can create new treatments and discover new cures. £24 could pay for two hours of research by an early career scientist, but every pound helps so please give what you can to help me hit my target.

Dad fought for years with a poorly heart starting with Angina then having to get a triple bypass in his forties. Oxford hospital were amazing with him. He carried on having check ups at the heart centre at NGH. Then things took a turn when dad went for a knee op and he had a massive heart attack resulting in us losing him quite a few times. He was strong and fought it each time. He stayed in ICU then moved to the ward where his heart just kept stopping. The nurses &amp; doctors were amazing with dad and us as a family. They transferred him to Oxford again where they monitored him and decided that they were going to do another bypass. The day before his op they found an aortic aneurysm, it was  to dangerous to operate. All they could do was fit dad with an defibrillator/pacemaker. A few years later dad was diagnosed with heart failure. There was nothing anyone could do!  Dad was a fighter until 2019 where he started to get sicker and was in and out of hospital. finally he took his last breath on 15th May 2020. Myself &amp; my daughter are doing this not only for my dad , but all the doctors &amp; nurses for the care and support that they gave dad and us as a family. Every penny raised will go into helping someone else and my dad was all about that helping others. ❤️</p>",NA,NA,My Dechox Fundraising Page,0,0,0,0,0,842603,Graham Bradbury ,/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/13796842,remember/842603,https://images.justgiving.com/image/3116a9dd-db60-4224-bfb7-cb6d9d134f05.jpg,https://images.justgiving.com/image/3116a9dd-db60-4224-bfb7-cb6d9d134f05.jpg?template=size150x150face,NA,NA,NA,NA,f0b38c95-8e29-421c-81e0-4a7b00151c83,Dechox 2021,https://www.justgiving.com/Sharon-Stanton2,/Sharon-Stanton2,United Kingdom,,My Dechox Fundraising Page,//images.justgiving.com/image/dc780b50-34fb-4169-af98-d5b2a9b39d70.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,15.241039,Sharon Stanton,2021-02-16T19:51:57,183092,6288571,2021-03-01T00:00:00,250,641389,45674bf9-4422-47bf-9cb1-dca56a126777,Leah and I are raising money,In memory of my dad who passed away in may 2020,British Heart Foundation,183092,225971,183092,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-02-17T06:59:48Z
