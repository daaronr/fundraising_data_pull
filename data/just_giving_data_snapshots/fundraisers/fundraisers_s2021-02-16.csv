It's only thanks to support from people like us that the BHF can create new treatments and discover new cures. £24 could pay for two hours of research by an early career scientist, but every pound helps so please give what you can to help me hit my target.

Various forms of monitoring I was diagnosed with tachycardia arrhythmia, an abnormally fast heartbeat. It took over most simple day to day duties and also the sports I love were a challenge! I had to have a surgical ablation which involves having a catheter through the groin and passing electrodes to the heart through the vessel and burning the abnormal heart cells. It was actually totally amazing to witness.. yes I was awake and saw most of it on the screen next to me. They ramped my heart up articfically a few times and then when they could locate the problem, they burnt it .. done. I haven't had one palpitation since and all I'm left with is a pretty cool scar on my chest from the monitor used to diagnose it that my boy believe at the time made me Ironman &#128514;.</p><p>The second thing everyone should know is I LOVE my chocolate and snacks... I wake up thinking of them and I go to bed thinking of them (sadly I'm not even joking). So all this leads me onto this challenge and the reason why I'm going to go 1 month with no chocolate, sweets or fizzy drinks. </p><p>I'm fully aware I have been very lucky even my diagnoses, there are many many more people who have far more serious problems of all ages, and I've also lost a few friends too young to undiagnosed heart conditions. I am also in total awe of heart surgeons and staff who keep people alive all day every day and I always help The British Heart Foundation in anyway I can so this is why I'm prepared to give up my beloved munchies to raise awareness and a small amount to say thank you!!</p><p>If you'd like to see me in a mood all March just for the fun of it, as believe me it may be worth a watch &#128555;, please give a little bit to this amazing charity so they can continue to fight the fight.</p><p><br/></p><p>THANK YOU ❤</p><p><br/></p><p>The pandemic is the biggest challenge we've faced in our 60 year history.

We want to help GOSH and the team at the Royal Papworth Hospital with the introduction into clinical practice of an innovative piece of medical equipment, by financing the conversion of an adult system into a paediatric system, suitable for use in children weighing less than 50kg. This would be a world's first and, if successful, could make a very significant impact on the survival of those children waiting for a heart transplant.<br/></span></p><p class=""jg-s-story"" style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);text-align: left;""><span>The ability to safely transplant a donor heart from non-heart beating donors could be a big shift to potentially increase the pool of viable donor hearts to help more patients suffering from end-stage heart failure. One of the most important factors in reducing organ rejection is the length of time the donated heart has stored on ice until transplanted; during this time the heart can be damaged and less suitable for transplant. <br/>It has been shown that adult hearts can been kept beating, warm, perfused with blood and for longer periods of time, before being transplanted, using a system that minimizes cold ischemia injury. This system pumps warm oxygenated blood and optimizes the condition of the organ by replenishing oxygen, nutrients, and hormones that would otherwise become depleted. The system can provide continuous monitoring and assessment of the organ until the point of transplantation.<br/></span></p><p class=""jg-s-story"" style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);text-align: left;""><span>Given the limitations of cold storage, it is estimated that globally 60-65% of donor hearts cannot ultimately be used for transplantation. The use of this piece of equipment could increase heart transplantation by up to 25% in the UK.<br/>To do this we need £85,000 to pay for the conversion of a proven adult system into one suitable for children and to pay for the costs of running a pilot project which we hope and believe will demonstrate the system can be used in clinical practice.<br/><span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></span></p><p class=""jg-s-story"" style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);text-align: left;""><span>Please help us achieve this target as quickly as possible.

Sadly, a few months later the cancer had returned and quickly spread to various places including her lungs and brain. In a very short time Mum went back into hospital in a lot of discomfort which was so hard for her and heartbreaking for us. Unable to be with her we made the decision to care for mum in her final days at home, something that would never have been possible without Marie Curie. Along with the NHS palliative care team, these ladies changed how we felt about home palliative care, their support meant we were able to spend mums precious last days by her side. Mum passed away on the 10th February 2021, just 7 short months after we found out the cancer was back.

The overwhelming majority of these deaths are in children under five years old. </span></p><p><font color=""#373737"">We've chosen to run for this charity because GiveWell has ranked Malaria Consortium as one of the top most effective and cost-efficient charities globally, describing the evidence of its impact as 'exceptionally strong'. According to their analysis, it costs just $7 (roughly £5) to protect a person from malaria with chemopreventive treatment, <span>equivalent</span> to a couple of coffees or a fancy pint down the pub. </font></p><p><font color=""#373737""><span>It's easy to glance over these things so it's worth repeating: a potentially life-saving treatment costs less than a takeaway pizza! </span></font></p><p><font color=""#373737"">GiveWell also estimates that it costs between $3,000 and $5,000 to save a life through Malaria Consortium, which makes this charity one of the most cost-effective ways to save a life. This is the reason for our rather odd-looking target: as of February 15th 2021, $5000 = £3,596. </font></p><p><font color=""#373737"">To understand why these figures are so different <span style=""color: rgb(55, 55, 55);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);float: none;"">($7 and $3-5000)</span>, we'd recommend checking out GiveWell's explanation here: https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities/citations#Cost_to_save_a_life. While <span>you're</span> there, make sure to check out the rest of the site to see the amazing work which GiveWell is doing. </font></p><p><font color=""#373737"">With this run, we're also hoping to raise awareness of Effective Altruism. Our knowledge of Malaria Consortium, GiveWell, and other outstanding opportunities to do good, only emerged thanks to our discovery of Effective Altruism, a movement which uses evidence-based reasoning to find answers to the question: 'how can we use our resources to help others the most?'. </font></p><p><font color=""#373737""><span>To get the lowdown on</span></font><span style=""color: rgb(55, 55, 55);""> Effective Altruism, we fully recommend the book 'Doing Good Better' by </span><span style=""color: rgb(55, 55, 55);"">William</span><span style=""color: rgb(55, 55, 55);""> MacAskill. It's a brilliant resource which can help you to learn how to do a frankly incredible amount of good no matter what your life circumstances are. It's the old cliché that 'everybody can make a difference', yet not only is this true, but the evidence shows that the difference you make can be truly life-altering if you know where to look. </span></p><p><font color=""#373737""><span>At a time when we're all stuck inside and feeling quite cut off from the world, making a donation to a charity like Malaria Consortium can help us to rediscover a vital sense of meaning and connectedness.

With your support, Oxfam can continue its life-saving work, it can continue to put together packages of food, give farming support, set up foodbanks, support education for women and girls, and provide cash to buy essentials.

For each £15 we raise, we could help more women to understand their rights, challenge discrimination and to take up leadership roles within their local communities.

For each £35, we could help families access emergency food supplies. 

£45 could provide one of our new handwashing stations to enable frequent handwashing and disease prevention.

With your support, communities can come together to help each other.
