This winter may be our toughest yet and I am helping to bring some community spirit by sharing my sparkle by supporting St John. 

St John volunteers treat and transport thousands of patients each year, and in times of crisis we are England's national health reserve.  

During the pandemic our skilled and highly trained volunteers are working long shifts supporting sick people and their families, in hospitals, in ambulances and at home. We are proud to be working alongside the nations ambulance trusts and in hospitals around the country.

""I enjoy helping people and its what I have been training to do. Its very rewarding personally knowing that my colleagues and I are making a difference to peoples lives when they most need it.""

My Grandpa had a Heart Attack in Front Of My Grandma and it was a real shock to us all as she was the one who was already very sick with Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and mobility problems. I am doing this for their memory, my Grandpa gave his all to Love her, taking her out of the home she was in because they were always so very much in love. I like to think that they know I am doing it for them and hope to make them proud even though we have now lost them both. I believe my Grandma died 6 months later from a broken heart &#128148; She even told her Carers, the day she died that Jack had come for her! It was just the sort of thing he would have done for her, anything and everything. I Love Chocolate and have a very sweet tooth so I am giving them up for March, please open your hearts and purses to support me, every penny helps ❤️ Thanks in Advance, Wendy. </p>",My Dechox Fundraising Page,0,0,0,0,0,NA,"I am giving up chocolate, sweets and fizzy drinks because I want my heart to last a lifetime.","I am giving up chocolate, sweets and fizzy drinks",I want my heart to last a lifetime.,829780,Jack  Grimshaw,/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/13667767,remember/829780,NA,NA,f0b38c95-8e29-421c-81e0-4a7b00151c83,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Dechox 2021,https://www.justgiving.com/Wendy-Allman,/Wendy-Allman,United Kingdom,,My Dechox Fundraising Page,//images.justgiving.com/image/dc780b50-34fb-4169-af98-d5b2a9b39d70.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,9.964425,Wendy Allman,2021-01-07T06:59:45,183092,6288571,2021-03-01T00:00:00,100,641389,61812852-88bf-40c9-863c-d4f51d3ffbe1,"I am giving up chocolate, sweets and fizzy drinks",I want my heart to last a lifetime.,British Heart Foundation,183092,225971,183092,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-01-08T06:21:24Z

The Hospice is often very different from what people expect  it is a warm, friendly space with beautiful gardens, delicious home-cooked food and personalised care. Every person is treated as an individual and helped to reach their goals and fulfil their wishes. A team of nurses, doctors, social workers, physiotherapists, chaplains, bereavement counsellors and pharmacists work together, putting every person at the centre of their care.  Throughout Covid-19 Bradford Hospice teams have been working around the clock to continue supporting local people. Death, dying and bereavement is at the forefront of peoples minds and Marie Curie knows what a difference the right care at the end of life can make.   They cant do any of this without your support. Thank you for your generous donation which supports the Bradford Hospice and Marie Curie care.</p><p>My mother was treated with respect, care and love and her symptoms were well controlled while cared for in the Bradford Hospice.  At present, due to the Covid restrictions, it is very difficult for the Hospice to raise vital money to maintain essential services.  Any contributions will make a difference.  Thank you..</p>",liz's page,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,829811,Ruby Wood,/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/13667693,remember/829811,https://images.justgiving.com/image/6e09a671-01c2-4140-a590-a1195e46ef83.jpg,https://images.justgiving.com/image/6e09a671-01c2-4140-a590-a1195e46ef83.jpg?template=size150x150face,0b7488b8-cf0a-4f28-81f7-e6520ece1445,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Borneo Trek 2022 - Bradford Hospice,https://www.justgiving.com/liz-Madden5,/liz-Madden5,United Kingdom,,liz's page,//images.justgiving.com/image/b7aa86aa-2d8d-40c1-aff0-9368f7ee087b.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,9.296502,liz Madden,2021-01-07T10:23:10,50,5715462,2022-05-12T00:00:00,3450,12130,c4c2f18b-9d46-4ea1-9f97-8ce3308c9366,NA,NA,Marie Curie,50,207994,50,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-01-08T06:21:24Z

Horrific. Yet, insanely, it gets very little attention in the media despite it being one of the worst humanitarian crises in recent memory.</p><p><span>After five years of conflict, most of the population in Yemen needs humanitarian assistance. They have a lack of basic healthcare, severe food shortages and limited clean water.  CARE is focused on helping the most vulnerable people, through distributing food to families in need, and cash vouchers so that families can purchase for themselves the food they need.Over a year of fighting and fuel shortages has destroyed water pipes and water pumping facilities, so CARE is rehabilitating water sources and providing water tanks so women and children can get safe drinking water without having to travel long distances.CARE is also providing hygiene kits, paying special attention to womens and children's needs.Thank you for reading.
