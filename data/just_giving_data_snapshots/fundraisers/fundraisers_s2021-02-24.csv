We work for Which? and we are fundraising for the British Heart Foundation in memory of our friend and colleague Sarah Price, who passed away suddenly last year at the age of 39. 

Sarah was a wonderful person; she excelled in her job but was also a committed team-player, going to great lengths to help her team members day-in, day-out. She was a brilliant friend: funny and kind, someone who always made time for everyone she encountered.

We continue to miss her greatly. 

Sarah was a big fan of Welsh rugby and so we are planning to run, walk or cycle a combined distance that will stretch from our Bristol office, where Sarah worked, to the Principality Stadium in Cardiff and back again, which is around 86 miles in total. We plan to do this over the weekend of 27 - 28 February 2021, being the weekend closest to both St. David's Day and Sarah's 5-year anniversary since she started at Which?.

Each participant will undertake 5km, either walking, running or cycling, to help us get to the total distance. 

The BHF has helped halve the number of people dying from heart and circulatory disease in the UK but sadly every day hundreds of people lose their lives. It's only thanks to donations that the BHF can create new treatments and discover new cures. £24 could pay for two hours of research by an early career scientist, but every pound helps so please give what you can to help us hit our target.
