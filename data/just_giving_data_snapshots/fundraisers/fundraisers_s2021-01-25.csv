At the point of being diagnosed the cancer had already spread and since then the cancer has spread further. Unfortunately, my Dad is just one of many people who have 'slipped through the net' at the doctors. For years my Dad has had symptoms and not once did the doctors encourage or ask my Dad to get tested. This simply isn't good enough. </span><br/></p><p>I'm doing these challenges to raise money for an amazing cause but even more so to raise awareness of prostate cancer. If you don't feel something is quite right, even after going to your GP please ask for a 2nd opinion or ask for further investigation. Please, please, please! I can't emphasise this enough. So many men and families are being the victim of negligence through their GP and it simply isn't good enough. My Dad has had symptoms for years and believed the words of his GP, like anyone would. Unfortunately, believing those words of his GP have resulted in an extremely late diagnosis of prostate cancer. My Dad was never encouraged to be tested, never received a reminder letter to be screened. Absolutely nothing. Please don't rely on reminder letters or expect GP's to send you to be screened as this really isn't the case. </p><p>Fast forward to January 2021 and my Dad is responding well to hormone treatment and we're enjoying everyday as much as we possibly can do in this crazy world that we're currently living in. Together, as a family we are fighting this awful disease head on and we won't be beaten. Positivity is key! </p><p>I have set myself five challenges which are going to physically, mentally and emotionally test me over the next few months. Having the amazing charity Macmillan and my Dad pushing me on, these challenges shall help me to stay focused and determined! I shall be giving each challenge 110%. In the process I shall be raising money to help more families and cancer patients through Macmillan. The work Macmillan do is incredible, just to be able to help one family would be amazing! Together, we can beat cancer, we just need to raise awareness of how important it is to look after our bodies and to take charge of our bodies when it means the most! </p><p>⭐Challenge 1: Cycle to Cornwall 350 miles! (Via home exercise bike in my livingroom!) - February </p><p>⭐Challenge 2: Climb Mount Snowdown (Via my stairs at home!) - March </p><p>⭐Challenge 3: Run 100KM - April </p><p>⭐Challenge 4: Sponsored silence for 24hrs! - May </p><p>⭐Challenge 5: Giving up the goodies for 1 month. Bye bye sweets, chocolate, crisps, sausage rolls, take aways and alcohol! - June </p><p>I shall also be doing a few fun, family activities/games that everyone can join in with! I'm also hoping to set myself a few more challenges throughout the year. </p><p><span>Thank you everyone for your support. </span><br/></p><p><span>Any donation will be extremely appreciated! However, if I could encourage just one person to be screened for cancer this would mean the world! </span></p><p>Charlotte  xxx</p><p><span>Thanks for supporting my fundraising.

Urgent tests, scans and an MRI discovered a small mass in Lisa’s right frontal lobe and surgery confirmed that the tumour was a right frontal Glioblastoma (WHO grade 4), unmethylated, which is the worst case scenario in the form of a brain tumour - the most aggressive type which claims 80% of patients within a year of being diagnosed.</p><p style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"">Obviously this was absolutely devastating news to Lisa and her family, especially cruel as Lisa had worked as a Nurse Practitioner for the NHS in Brighton and Horsham for over 30 years, a job which she loved and immediately had to stop. An additional blow was dealt as she could no longer drive and Lisa lost her independence.</p><p style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"">Soon after the diagnosis Lisa started a six week course of chemoradiotherapy followed by a course of Temozolomide Chemo tablets, however another MRI in June 2018 revealed suspicions of progressive disease rather than pseudo progression. It was decided to proceed with second line chemotherapy in the form of a PCV regimen. The treatment was brutal, with very bad side effects. Lisa completed three treatment cycles and was then referred to Charing Cross Hospital where she was offered further surgery and the chance to embark on a trail treatment of Chemo tablets and a plant based product by the name of Sativex. Further surgery was performed in December 2018 which went well and the surgeon was able to remove more tumour than he had first envisaged.</p><p style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"">Although the surgery was a success there was never going to be a positive outcome and unfortunately Lisa started to deteriorate and before long she was receiving exceptional care from the Macmillan nurses from the Midhurst branch.

We have completed the Hadrian's Wall Cycleway, Coast and Castles South Cycleway, Outer and Inner Hebrides Tour. <br/>It happened on the last trip to the Inner Hebrides that on Day 4 cycling back through the Isle of Jura and onto the Isle on Islay that we decided to add on a visit to the local distilleries. After sampling some of the finer blends of Bunnahabhain, we made our way back to the main road. With the beautiful Paps of Jura in the background, he couldn’t have picked a finer spot. My mum said it was the expensive whiskey that did it!!<br/>Every penny of our fundraising will go to the British Heart Foundation on life saving research and support for heart patients and the risk factors that cause them.<br/></p>",AFCO Lincoln's 100km for the Heart,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,https://images.justgiving.com/image/c60826e4-4d75-4d07-ae0a-2b56bcea2315.jpg,https://images.justgiving.com/image/c60826e4-4d75-4d07-ae0a-2b56bcea2315.jpg?template=size150x150face,"Terri, Isla, Chris, Gaz and Tanya",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Peak District Challenge 2021,https://www.justgiving.com/AFCO-Lincoln,/AFCO-Lincoln,United Kingdom,...AFCO Lincoln's 100km for the <strong>Heart</strong>...,AFCO Lincoln's 100km for the Heart,//images.justgiving.com/image/c0c61e0b-ee7c-4089-83de-23ba7a904dc8.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,12.111954,AFCO Lincoln Team,We are completing 100km within 24 hours,"We love a challenge, and this certainly is one!",2021-01-24T16:48:37,183092,5471427,2021-07-03T00:00:00,1000,641389,5a004ee9-bbac-4cb1-9962-823c8c6525c2,British Heart Foundation,183092,225971,183092,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-01-25T07:00:43Z

I know I’ll  have cravings for the 1st week.

Most will think it’s not exactly challenging (usually those without a sweet tooth).  Well actually this year I’ve chosen to do chocolate, sweets and fizzy drinks which will include my favourite tipple gin and lemonade. It probably doesn’t seem like a challenge, but for me it will be a personal one. Life doesn’t always bring you flowers but sometimes my sweet tooth brings me a little bit of happiness. A whole month without some comfort, especially in these lockdown times, can seem like forever and very sad.</p><p style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);"">The BHF are a charity I try and give back to. I lost my Dad back in 2003 and in today’s world with the advances the charity have made in their research and technologies, he’d probably have been saved and still be here. Since then, my grandad’s life was saved through to scientific knowledge and the wonderful skills of the cardiologists who were better equipped.

So I jumped at the opportunity to be involved and help raise money for such an amazing cause that's close to everyone's heart and lives.</p><p>I lost my Dad a little while back and it crushed my world, devastated me and changed my life forever. My Dad would now be 53 years young if he was here today. Unfortunately I lost my dad through multiple illness's that could not be helped. I'm sure there's many others out there in similar circumstances or that will face them circumstances in the future or will know somebody who will or who does already. it happens more often than not in todays day and age. So if I can help to raise as much money as possible to help someone to not go through similar to what I did or to preserve their life and time here on this earth with loved ones to make more memories and make it as best as possible then here I am!</p><p>Me and my father had a personal joke/bet between us, he said I would never get my weight down to a certain point - 75kg. At the time I was over 106kg. more into weights and meant I was running like a bus with 3 flat tyres. 23/01/2021 was the day I conquered that goal. Now I have completed that I know he used to love boxing and running, so I am now taking on a running challenge as it keeps us close!</p><p>all it takes is one person to make a difference! I will be making that difference starting February 1st 2021.</p><p>100% of all donations that are received will go directly to Cancer Research UK. </p><p>as its a tough time in society I understand not everyone has large amounts of spare cash so I appreciate every token and gesture no matter how big or small! it all goes a long way in helping to make a difference in others lives!</p><p>if you want to keep up with my February journey I will be posting updates along the way! more updates will be found on my social media platform on instagram @JCPT23</p><p>Thank you for taking the time out to visit my JustGiving page. Please forward this on to others so this reaches as many eyes as possible in hope to raise as much awareness for this amazing life changing cause. if you are in a tough position please just forward my page on to others who may be able to help! its just as good. I Appreciate every bit of help that's offered.</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

He got sick very quickly requiring oxygen and a lot of support. After being discharged from Hospital he was required to be put into a care home but as a family we were not going to let that happen. Grandad went to live with my mum and Dad and received care from them. As Grandad got worse and more confused towards the end my mum and Dad were very tired emotionally and physically. They got in touch with Marie Curie who arranged for a carer to come to the house for night time support so my Parents could get some much needed sleep. It’s amazing how different a bit of sleep can make you feel. Myself and Danny want to get healthier this year so have decided we are going to do this challenge and hopefully raise some money for a great cause too. Especially at the moment charity’s are struggling as not able to do there normal fundraising events so by supporting things like this is will be a massive help and they can continue to give the support to other family’s who need it too.
