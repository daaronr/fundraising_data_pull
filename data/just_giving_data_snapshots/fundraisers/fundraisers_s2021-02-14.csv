Shortly after arriving at the hospital, I was diagnosed with a rare kidney condition called cystinuria. My kidneys were completely blocked with cystine stones causing them to fail. Ever since then, I have been under the fantastic care of GOSH, I have had over 10 successful surgeries in my time there, and they have never failed to provide me with the mental and physical support when I was struggling. Sadly, as I approach the age of 18 it's time for me to leave GOSH and begin care in an adult hospital. Not only did Great Ormond Street save my life, they provided the care and support for my family and allowed me to live like any regular child, continuing the things I love to do. It has felt like a second home to me since I was young and I will always be grateful for the hardworking, affectionate team at GOSH, who provide not only treatment, but a place that feels like home to seriously ill children.</p><p>So, as a patient myself, and someone who has lived the GOSH experience, I'd like to push myself out of my comfort zone in order to raise money for this incredible hospital and to support future <span>children like myself. Over the course of March 2021, I will be running 100 miles and recording my progress here, if you would like to contribute in any way, I would appreciate it very much.</span></p><p>For more information, please feel free to contact me at:</p><p>skyemae@icloud.com</p><p><br/></p>",Skye's 100 miles in March,0,0,0,0,0,I'd like to raise money and support because I want to return the love they gave to me.,I'd like to raise money and support,I want to return the love they gave to me.,true,NA,NA,NA,NA,Skye's 100 miles in March,https://www.justgiving.com/Skye-Kukiatkul,/Skye-Kukiatkul,United Kingdom,,Skye's 100 miles in March,//images.justgiving.com/image/59b6790e-963a-455a-a93d-081a6885384c.png?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,27.126818,Skye Kukiatkul,I'd like to raise money and support,I want to return the love they gave to me.,2021-02-13T18:16:14,254,6520702,2021-02-13T18:16:14,500,12057,5f74b8c7-2e18-49a2-a4d0-f01101ff532a,Great Ormond Street Hospital,254,1160024,254,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-02-14T06:57:44Z
