This is quite a complex surgery which involves opening up the mothers stomach and womb, exposing the Spina Bifida but keeping baby in the sac and not delivering him, closing the hole in the spine, putting baby back inside the womb safely and stitching mum back up.

At this stage baby is still able to move and kick his legs around in the womb so one of the major benefits of this surgery is although it won’t be able to cure the Spina Bifida as nothing can, it can prevent any further damage being done from now until he is born. Which means preserving the movement he has in his legs at the minute and this gives him a greater chance of being able to walk.

Any donations towards Great Ormond Street Children’s Charity would be greatly appreciated from the both of us as the only way this surgery can be offered on the NHS is if they can rely on donations from the public towards this charity. Any shares of our story are also greatly appreciated to raise awareness of this surgery as many people don’t know this 3rd choice exists.

Among the challenges to achieving the UNICEF Sustainable Development Goals for children are the unprecedented levels of humanitarian crises, including the global pandemic of COVID-19, and a climate shaped by limited predictable resources. </i><br/><span>This year, the <b>UNICEF ESCP- London society</b> will focus on <b>Nepal</b>. At present, Nepal is the third poorest among 58 countries in Asia with the sixth lowest human development ranking. Children are over-represented among the poor with 31% of children under 18 years of age living in poverty. </span><br/></p><p><i><b>Some facts that persist despite the global pandemic:</b></i><br/><u>Health</u> - Quality of water is poor with 71% of all water sources and 91% of those used by the poorest quintile contaminated with Escherichia coli bacteria, beyond the World Health Organization standard.<br/><u>Nutrition</u> - 10% of children under five years of age don’t meet the minimum nutrition requirements. <br/><u>Education and Safety</u> - Issues that persist in education include poor quality and inequity in access, gender, socioeconomic and ethnic differences. Only a few schools meet the child-friendly school standards and only 11% of school buildings are earthquake-resistant. </p><p><i><b>What, as a society we, with UNICEF, plan to achive</b></i><br/><u>Target 1 Health:</u> By 2022, children and women of reproductive age have improved and equitable access to and use of high-impact quality health interventions and improved healthy behaviors. <br/><u>Target 2 Nutrition: </u>By 2022, children and women of reproductive age have improved and equitable access to and use of adequate nutritious diets and improved nutritional behavior and care practices<br/><u>Target 3 Education and Safety:</u> By 2022, all children, especially the most disadvantaged, benefit from improved access to, participation in and learning outcomes in pre-primary and basic education within inclusive, safe and protective environments. Children have improved protection from all forms of violence, abuse and exploitation. <br/></p><p></p><p><i><b>Support us! </b></i></p><p><i>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.
