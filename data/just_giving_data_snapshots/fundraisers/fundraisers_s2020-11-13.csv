Because despite everything else happening at the moment, heart and circulatory diseases are still the worlds biggest killers. For the sake of our mums and dads, brothers and sisters, grandparents and friends - we cant drop the ball now.

We got sent up to Jessops (Sheffield) straight away but they didn’t recheck me. Instead they left us alone with our thoughts for what it was the longest weekend of our lives. But at that point they were telling us the best thing we could do for our baby was to terminate the pregnancy as baby was going to be severely impaired.</p><p>We googled, lots of stuff, Arnold Chiari malformation, spina bifida, life expectancy... they were all dreadful news. We were soul and mentally destroyed.</p><p>On Monday we went to the Fetal Medicine Unit and I was walked on my own to a small private room. A counselling room. They confirmed by scan that our baby had spina bifida, the most severe form, a myelomeningocele. It was also confirmed our baby had a brain malformation as consequence of this, Arnold Chiari type II.</p><p>By then, we already read lots and we came across the MOM’s study in USA and we also knew there was the option of a prenatal surgery. We didn’t know if we were suitable but after checking UCLH guidelines we knew we were pretty close to be.</p><p>In Jessops, we were given 2 choices,, to terminate the pregnancy or carry on with the possibility of terminate at any stage.We knew that we actually had 3 choices so we pushed for the prenatal surgery.</p><p>That day, I got an amniocentesis to discard there weren’t any other chromosomical problems with our baby and an MRI programmed around 20/40w of pregnancy.</p><p>We weren’t given more information, no leaflets, nothing else than a telephone number and the promise there would be somebody at the end of the phone for us if we change our mind or we needed to talk to anyone.</p><p>We continued our research and kept reading about the difference this surgery was making in babies in the USA and how there were other couples who have had this surgery in the U.K.</p><p>This surgery is a complex surgery, they opened mum’s abdomen and expose uterus and unborn baby and repair baby’s NTD in situ. It has incredibly benefits in baby’s prognosis of walking and also with the Arnold Chiari malformation and it also reduces the chances of baby needing a shunt later on in life. If this surgery gets done before the 26 weeks landmark, it prevents the amniotic fluid to further damage baby’s nerves and therefore preserves most of its functionality. </p><p>I also came across SHINE, who were really helpful and our our mind at ease and also I found Elouise’ mum blog regarding her own experience. I felt so identified that I bursted into tears and after few days I gained some strength to message her to say thank you, thank you for her page and for bring light to such a dark time in our lives at the time.</p><p>At the time I got the MRI we were given the same news we already knew followed by some not helpful comments such us ‘our baby’s head was in disproportion to the rest of the body’, which I disputed and wasn’t accurate, but it was heartbreaking as we were, once again, told that our baby won’t reach a nice future, won’t be able to live by itself, work or even walk.</p><p>At that time we knew already that this condition was also known as the ‘snowflake condition’ and also, thanks to my medical background I knew there wasn’t any evidence behind those comments, but this didn’t make it less hurtful.<br/><br/>When all the results were back, we had another appointment at Jessops with Professor Anumba who was absolutely incredible, showed us lots of patience and resolved our thousand million doubts.</p><p>We asked to be referred to UCLH for a consultation regarding the prenatal surgery as at this point we were sure we were meeting their criteria. But he also referred us for another consultation just in case this wasn’t successful, so we had all our options covered. He was incredible and really supportive.</p><p>After a long week, of waiting (this was already September), we got a call from Emma, fellow researcher and doctor who was extremely sympathetic and supportive during the whole of our journey with the team. She confirmed that everything was looking right but have to send our details to Professor Jan Deprest to confirm all.</p><p>Shortly after we discovered, again thanks to Elouise’ mum, a group on Facebook that has been our anchor and saviour along this journey, lots of parents who have endured this same journey as us before. Everybody has been extremely helpful and supportive and they even meet from time to time with their babies and celebrate their tiny warriors milestones!</p><p>We were much positive at that time, because initially we fell alone and like this was some kind of punishment and also wondering: why us? We did everything by the book, folic acid tablets previous to pregnancy and up to 14 weeks (instead 12)... it has been a really tough journey with lots of bumps and ups and downs during the way.</p><p>We had our surgery last 27th of October in Belgium. I don’t have words to praise the work that Professor Jan Deprest and his team do for these kids. There are no words to say how thankful we are that our baby got this opportunitty and the massive difference it will (and already is) make to its life..</p><p>And also, we are so thankful for everybody back in Leuven (doctors, anaesthetic team, midwives, student midwives, cleaners, waitresses... the list goes on) but also so thankful to the NHS for give us this opportunity and funding our baby’s surgery.<br/><br/> Any donations towards Great Ormond Street Children’s Charity would be greatly appreciated from the both of us as the only way this surgery can be offered on the NHS is if they can rely on donations from the public towards this charity.

This can help keep up the good work that Cancer charities do.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></span></p><p>Cancer is a subject which is close to my heart - I have had the most important person in my life affected by it and taken from me. <br/><br/>Besides doing race for life a few years ago, I have always wanted to do more for Cancer charities. The first thing I have decided to do is donate 15 inches of my 29 inch hair. As soon as lockdown is over I will be going to the hairdresser to do this. The hair will be donated through a Charity (Little Princess Trust) for children who have been affected by cancer and are going through hair loss - donating my hair will allow a wig to be made for a child.<br/><br/>My Mum’s Story - <span>My mum battled with cancer 3 times. In November 2016 we were told my mum had a tumour. After undergoing major surgery in January 2017, my mum was diagnosed with stage 4 aggressive ovarian cancer. Shortly after this, my mum started chemotherapy. She went through many physical changes including hair loss but the treatment was successful. However, soon after this her tumour markers began to increase - the cancer was active and was growing. She had a second round of chemotherapy and again this was successful in stopping the spread of the cancer. </span></p><p><span>Just before the COVID-19 pandemic, my mums tumour markers began to increase.  A few months later the cancer was back and growing faster than ever. The doctors advised for her to be on chemo tablets before undergoing another cycle of chemotherapy. After being on tablets for a short while, her scans showed an increase in the spread. However at this time, unfortunately we had gone into lockdown due to the pandemic. Because of this my mums appointments and treatments got delayed. She of course had to shield and didn't go out for several months until she was advised too. </span></p><p>There was supposed to be many memorable moments including my sisters wedding - this was meant to be in May but was cancelled due to the lockdown. When my mum finally went for a scan the results were not <span>good. She started her third round of chemotherapy and after one treatment my mum was not in good health. She kept getting infections which delayed her next treatment. As she got rid of those infections, she had a second treatment and once again fell sick - this delayed her chemotherapy for another few weeks when it was meant to be administered on a weekly basis. The changes in her appearance were striking and she got worse every day.  </span></p><p>In mid-October, we were told her treatment was not working and it would not be carried on. This meant there was no other options for us and no one could really be sure of how fast the cancer would spread and how much time we would have left with her. To fulfil one of her dreams, my sister got married in the last week of October. My mum soldiered on to be as fit as she could be for this and happily saw out all of the wedding events. However, within a week her health changed rapidly - she needed equipment to help aid her throughout her day and routine. She deteriorated quicker then anyone could imagine. We had to be her 24 hour carers throughout the day and night. This feeling is unexplainable and it is very hard to see the person you love most being in so much pain. Sadly on 9th November my beloved mother passed away in the early hours of the morning. She waited to see all her siblings and shortly left us that night with all of her family by her side. <br/><br/>We can’t believe this has happened to such a kind and beautiful soul. We are all still in shock that our mum has been taken from us and she had to struggle in the last 3 years of her life - at such a young age. She was a strong lady who impacted everyone positively in her life. My mum was the light of our lives, she kept everyone together, she was brave, she was strong and she fought so hard till the very end. Her suffering has ended and now she is able to rest in peace. She brought our family up on good morals, values and made us strong - even when she was unwell. </p><p><br/>I didn't have the chance to tell my mum I would be doing this for her as she was taken so fast from us. Donating my hair and raising money is my tribute to my mum and will help me carry on her legacy. I hope our angel is watching over us. <br/>Rest peacefully mum. We will meet again one day &#129344;<br/></p>",My Mums Story,153.75,0,732.81,73,0,Usha Sandhu,To raise funds because no one should have to go through Cancer.,To raise funds,no one should have to go through Cancer.,819263,Usha Devi Sandhu ,/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/13526123,remember/819263,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,In memory of Usha Devi Sandhu,https://www.justgiving.com/Fight-cancer-now,/Fight-cancer-now,United Kingdom,,My Mums Story,//images.justgiving.com/image/Inmem_web.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true&sourcepath=Stock,Fundraiser,16.289928,Tania Sandhu,To raise funds,no one should have to go through Cancer.,2020-11-12T19:46:27,2357,6342470,2020-11-12T19:46:27,1000,13174,a5e7d6e7-88e9-4ea8-99e5-62ee210fdcf8,Cancer Research UK,2357,1089464,2357,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2020-11-13T06:16:56Z

Mainly though, we lost Grandma 4 days before Christmas 2019 and I don't want anybody else to have the same story we do.

Once stabilised this then enabled him to return home for the last four months of his life. Due to the Covid-19 epidemic the hospice, despite tight restrictions, endeavoured to make the hospice is as comfortable as possible for patients and visitors. Alan particularly enjoyed the home-cooked food. The make every effort to treat each person as an individual and help them to reach their goals and fulfil their wishes, which was to be as pain free as possible and return to his own home. A team of nurses, doctors, social workers, physiotherapists, chaplains, bereavement counsellors and pharmacists work together, putting every person at the centre of their care.
