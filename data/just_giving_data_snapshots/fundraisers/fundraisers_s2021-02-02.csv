This winter may be our toughest yet and I am helping to bring some community spirit by sharing my sparkle by supporting St John. 

St John volunteers treat and transport thousands of patients each year, and in times of crisis we are England's national health reserve.  

During the pandemic our skilled and highly trained volunteers are working long shifts supporting sick people and their families, in hospitals, in ambulances and at home. We are proud to be working alongside the nations ambulance trusts and in hospitals around the country.

Every single day at the hospice is an extraordinary day. 

We listen, support and give high-quality care during what can be a difficult, challenging and distressing time. And we get to know people as individuals, find out what makes them happy, and help to make those things happen.

That might mean sitting with them in the hospice garden, or arranging for their pet to visit them at the hospice. We focus on the special things that bring people joy.

We also provide important support for carers and families, including bereavement support and counselling.

We need to raise £6,150 per day to run the hospice, so every penny counts. Thank you for helping to make sure more people with a terminal illness in and around Belfast, get the care and support they need.

With your support, Oxfam can continue its life-saving work, it can continue to put together packages of food, give farming support, set up foodbanks, support education for women and girls, and provide cash to buy essentials.

For each £15 we raise, we could help more women to understand their rights, challenge discrimination and to take up leadership roles within their local communities.

For each £35, we could help families access emergency food supplies.
