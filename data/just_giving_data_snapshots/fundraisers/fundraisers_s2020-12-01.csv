I have taken up sewing clothing as my hobby during lockdown and I love creating silly fabric scenes with my baby Boy Edward to make people smile. </p><p>I have come up with the idea of creating 12 scenes with my little model based around the 12 days of Christmas song. You can join in by viewing our progress, giving me any scene ideas and donating if you can. I'm going to aim to have completed 12 silly scenes by Christmas eve! </p><p>Sadly I have lost family members to cancer and had another battle cancer to get her all clear result. So for my courageous Auntie who I only got to meet as baby, my sweet Nana with her crosswords, my Grandad who once gifted me a tiger toy and my awesome cousin this is for you xx</p><p><br/></p><p>Thanks for supporting my fundraising.

She'd noticed that the tips of her fingers had become quite sensitive and sore, and her nails had started to clump. A similar thing happened to my auntie a couple of years ago, and it turned out to be lung cancer, so my mum went straight to her GP for some answers. After a series of tests and pokes of a needle, it was confirmed that she does in fact have stage 3 lung cancer. This year has been tough for everyone, for many different reasons, and not being able to see her due to covid was hard enough without this adding to it. Luckily for her it's treatable, and she's hopefully due surgery very soon. She'll be without the majority of her right lung, and there's a long road to recovery ahead, but she's going to be okay. That's the best news anyone could ever tell you.</span><br style=""color: rgb(255, 255, 255);text-align: left;background-color: rgb(0, 153, 255);""/><br style=""color: rgb(255, 255, 255);text-align: left;background-color: rgb(0, 153, 255);""/><span style=""color: rgb(255, 255, 255);text-align: left;background-color: rgb(0, 153, 255);"">But I know that not everyone is that lucky. Not everyone is told that they're going to be okay, or that their loved ones are going to recover. So this is why I have chosen to do a charity stream for Macmillan Cancer Support. They're there for so many people that are living with cancer, going through treatments, and trying to live the best life that they possibly can. I am so grateful for all the support they give, all the fundraising they do, and what they stand for.</span><br style=""color: rgb(255, 255, 255);text-align: left;background-color: rgb(0, 153, 255);""/><br style=""color: rgb(255, 255, 255);text-align: left;background-color: rgb(0, 153, 255);""/><span style=""color: rgb(255, 255, 255);text-align: left;background-color: rgb(0, 153, 255);"">For more information about this wonderful organisation, visit the website;</span><br style=""color: rgb(255, 255, 255);text-align: left;background-color: rgb(0, 153, 255);""/><br style=""color: rgb(255, 255, 255);text-align: left;background-color: rgb(0, 153, 255);""/><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.macmillan.org.uk/?fbclid=IwAR2pbarBzCCYBhblRYpmzW32HeIKexWdfCXntXaz7zC1-9tTFZgQvNhqrAE"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" style=""color: rgb(255, 255, 255);text-align: left;background-color: rgb(0, 153, 255);"">https://www.macmillan.org.uk</a><br style=""color: rgb(255, 255, 255);text-align: left;background-color: rgb(0, 153, 255);""/><br style=""color: rgb(255, 255, 255);text-align: left;background-color: rgb(0, 153, 255);""/><span style=""color: rgb(255, 255, 255);text-align: left;background-color: rgb(0, 153, 255);"">I am going to be doing a charity stream on Twitch on December 13th from 7pm.

When she first became ill (and beat cancer in her first brave battle) she had a round of radiotherapy and I sent her a song a day to listen to during the treatment, which she said kept her smiling throughout.

She dedicated her whole life both professionally and personally to helping people feel better about themselves. I didn't tell her enough what a true inspiration she was. Nor did I spend enough time trying to make her happier when she needed it.<br/><br/>Since that morning I have been overwhelmed by the love and support from a number of friends and family who have told me what my mum meant and represented to them. The consistent themes of happiness, positivity, humility, empathy and fun have been repeated in all the messages I've received.<br/><br/>She was a beautiful human being in every sense of the word and I'm going to make sure her spark and spirit live on through the stories and lessons I pass down to Martha who I'm so glad mum got chance to meet. <br/><br/>I know 2020 has hit people hard so I'm only asking you to donate if you can afford to - any small amount will help keep me strumming my four chord disasters!</p><p>James x</p>",NA,NA,James' Advent 2020 Unplugged,40,0,200,100,0,NA,NA,Abusing your ears and eyes for Advent! because the battle against cancer can't 'lockdown',Abusing your ears and eyes for Advent!,the battle against cancer can't 'lockdown',NA,James' Advent 2020 Unplugged,https://www.justgiving.com/JamesClegg2020,/JamesClegg2020,United Kingdom,,James' Advent 2020 Unplugged,//images.justgiving.com/image/407a39ec-9d61-4652-9b64-e395e861a046.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,13.341891,James Clegg,Abusing your ears and eyes for Advent!,the battle against cancer can't 'lockdown',2020-11-30T19:42:33,2357,6382240,2020-11-30T19:42:33,200,13174,c83a311a-d4c6-4f39-b43c-11c411d9769f,Cancer Research UK,2357,1089464,2357,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2020-12-01T06:15:28Z

On 27<sup>th</sup> July 2020 she sadly lost her fight to terminal brain cancer. Currently due to COVID people like my Grandma are suffering from terminal illnesses alone, with little access to their loved ones to alleviate their struggles. Nurses are doing everything they can in these unmanageable times, but the truth is with little support and underfunding, the NHS cannot provide the care patients desperately require. </span></p><p><span style=""color: #262626;"">The light of this story is the care my Grandma received once in palliative care in her own home. Regardless of her months of turmoil, a nurse named Jovie was able to bring comfort and happiness to my Grandmas last days, providing physical and emotional care. Jovie demonstrated that people living with terminal illnesses can still have a quality life, and I would like to ensure others get the same experience.<span>  </span></span></p><p><span style=""color: #262626;"">That being said, on the 19<sup>th </sup>December 2020, I will be challenging myself to complete a back to back triple marathon.

Some of the people we support stay in our in-patient unit, where relatives and friends can visit any time of the day or night and stay with their loved ones if they wish to.

We also support local people with clinics, therapies and activities during the day  including one-to-one care, groups and things like reiki and massage. 

As well as people with a terminal illness, we also support carers and families with things like bereavement support groups where people can share their experiences and feelings.

Just 3 weeks after diagnosis the time came for Craig to be cared for at Marie Curie Holme Tower hospice. None of us knew what to expect and  the unknown was frightening and overwhelming. However, the staff were  exceptional, caring for Craig and all of us. They made it possible for the hospice to become our home for over 2 weeks. We were able to celebrate Craig's 26th birthday whilst we were there. We will be eternally grateful to the amazing staff for providing us with the the opportunity to make the most of the precious time we had left together. As  a way of honouring Craig  and showing our gratitude to the amazing staff we're hoping to raise enough money to pay for a day at Marie Curie Holme Tower hospice which will be commemorated by a plaque in Craig's name. It's costs a staggering £6660 to run the hospice for 1 day, we were fortunate to have 16 days with Craig in the hospice.  Any support would be really appreciated. </p><p style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Your support will provide other families with the same exceptionl care Craig and all of us received.
