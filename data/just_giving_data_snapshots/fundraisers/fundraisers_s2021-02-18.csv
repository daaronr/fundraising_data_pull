Even more awareness is important around Cancer and the effects it has on a lot of people and even more so during the Covid pandemic. 

Sadly we all have our loses and stories to tell and this is to honor them and help others fighting this horrible disease. 

Individuals will complete a 15k run or 100k cycle starting at 8am and share their pictures and completion time to help inspire others and complete a personal challenge raising much needed funds... Personal fitness challenges are needed also for mental health during a challenging time, so this benefits a lot of people who have recently started running or cycling, or literally want to train harder.

Please support us all as motivation is needed. 

Taking part, a team of all ages - Lee Kirton, Andrew Minty, Barry Keating, Bren Kelly, Brian Simpson, Katy Simpson, Gordon Simpson, Jo Simpson, Claire Simpson, Archie Simpson, Duncan Purves, Jonathan Chambers, Laurence Bray, Mark Croxon, Mark Hughes, Simon Barratt, Simon Maxwell, Paul (Spike) Murrells, Tony Hinton, Jim Kench, Elle Kench, Mia Kench, Tom Wallace, Alison Beasley, Jake Mattock, Alvin Hussey, Reda Asakaviciute, Jorge Sanchez and Cat Channon.

It is often very different place from what people expect -  it is a warm, friendly space with beautiful gardens, delicious home-cooked food and personalised care.

A team of nurses, doctors, social workers, physiotherapists, chaplains, bereavement counsellors and pharmacists work together, putting every person at the centre of their care.  Throughout Covid-19 Bradford Hospice teams have been working around the clock to continue supporting local people.

Its a warm and welcoming place where we give expert care to people with a terminal illness, and their loved ones, every day of the year. 

Our hospice team includes doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, social workers and many more, and is supported by over 200 volunteers  who play a vital role in the running of the hospice.

We have a 24-bed in-patient unit, where relatives and friends can visit any time of the day or night, and stay with their loved ones if they wish.

Our out-patient unit offers clinics, therapies and group sessions  and freshly cooked lunches made by our chefs. We also support carers and families, including children, with practical advice, counselling and bereavement support groups.

We need to raise £9,600 per day to run the hospice, so every penny counts. Thank you for helping to make sure more people with a terminal illness in Solihull get the care and support they need.

2021 is a vital year in the global campaign to make our world one without malaria. This coming June, the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and the vitally important Kigali Summit on malaria and neglected tropical diseases will take place in Rwanda. The summit marks a historic moment that will unite global leaders and put a spotlight on the importance of renewed action in fighting malaria. We need more action, more innovation, more funding and more political leadership to defeat malaria and move forward stronger in this new global health landscape.

Across Rentokil Initial, colleagues are taking part in a 9,000km Race to Kigali (the distance between our HQ and Kigali, Rwanda), including teams from America, Australia, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Caribbean, Africa, HR, IT, Finance, M&A and Legal. By combining the efforts of colleagues walking, running or cycling, each team will ‘reach’ the distance to Kigali.  This is our global effort to raise funds and show our support for this vital cause.  It all starts on Monday 15 February through to the UN’s World Malaria Day on 25 April.

Andy Ransom: ""As a proud patron of Malaria No More UK, I am asking my colleagues at Rentokil Initial, as well as friends, family and associates to get involved in the Race to Kigali. In doing so, helping raise incredibly important funding for Malaria No More UK at such a critical time. Rentokil Initial Cares, our charitable fund, will match every £1 raised up to £100,000.”
