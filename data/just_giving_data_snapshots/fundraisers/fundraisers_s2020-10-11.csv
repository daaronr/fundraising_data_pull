You can choose to Run100, Cycle100 or Swim100 between 1 July and 31 November. However you take on your 100, get sponsored to do it and help us supporting people living with sight loss. 

You could complete 100 metres, 100 minutes, 100 days  be creative!

The sponsorship money you raise will make a difference. £100 could pay for five hours' training at a Guide Dogs training school.

It's thanks to people like you that we can continue to provide life-changing services, like our guide dogs, to people with sight loss. So, a huge thank you and lots of luck for your challenge!

Thus I am looking at the prospect of running a solo (virtual) marathon around my home area...<br/><br/>In support of this I have asked friends and family to help me on my marathon in a number of ways:<br/><br/>1. Runners or cyclists to run  / cycle at a socially responsible distance from me in the later stages of the race.<br/><br/>2. Virtual Cheerers (is that even a word?) to phone me and provide encouragement at the later sections of the race.<br/><br/>3. Physical Cheerers who may also have new water bottles and/or jelly babies.<br/><br/>4. People who are willing to Sponsor me.<br/><br/>If I get enough support I may (read could be convinced) be willing to try 50k before 50!<br/><br/>This marathon is likely to happen April next year (not due to training time - I'm up to half marathons in my training atm so I doubt I need quite that long!!) - mostly so the weather isn't appalling and to give me time to recruit friends to help. / support...and deal with any logistics!<br/></p><p>So Thanks for taking the time to visit my JustGiving page.</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

My wonderful mom has T cell lymphoma which is a rare form of cancer there're only a handful of cases diagnosed a year which makes diagnosis difficult and in the coming week she will start chemotherapy for 6 months, with a stem cell transplant once treatment has finished. So, of course to help cancer research and those it may effect in the future it's a no brainer to try and raise awareness as priority and money to help find a cure for anyone who is diagnosed with cancer.
