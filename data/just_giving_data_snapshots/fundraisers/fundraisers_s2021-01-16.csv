So we decided we wanted to get up from our desks to help support this fantastic charity - and our own furry, four-legged friends.</p><p>So, we've come up with a cunning plan to raise money for Guide Dogs for the Blind by jointly dog walking 1000kms, or the broad equivalent of Lands’ End to John O'Groats...in 10 weeks.</p><p>We've provided stuffed toy dog companions for colleagues without dogs but with little kiddies to tempt them out. For colleagues without kids or dogs they can borrow dogs; or walk with their dog-owning support bubbles. There's no excuse not to get out into the winter air and putting the kilometres in!</p><p>And you can help us by donating anything you can for this fabulous charity and helping us reach our goal of £1/kilometre. Anything from £1/100kms, to £1/km, everything is welcome and appreciated! And just think, when it's cold, dark and miserable out there it's us that will be out walking whilst you're tucked up warm and dry... but our dogs will thank you for it, and so will we.</p>",Meet & Engage - Guide Dogs Charity Challenge,0,0,0,0,0,NA,https://images.justgiving.com/image/532e7eac-d6aa-422c-802e-3ee9695fdbdf.jpg,https://images.justgiving.com/image/532e7eac-d6aa-422c-802e-3ee9695fdbdf.jpg?template=size150x150face,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,56067dbb-584d-4bed-aa54-75d6865fb3f2,1000k Team Walk Challenge,https://www.justgiving.com/GuideDogsMeetandEngage,/GuideDogsMeetandEngage,United Kingdom,...Meet & Engage - <strong>Guide</strong> <strong>Dogs</strong> Charity Challenge...,Meet & Engage - Guide Dogs Charity Challenge,//images.justgiving.com/image/80ee234b-28af-4d56-8221-fa9d3daa4edd.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,44.85566,Ali Hackett,We are Meet & Engage!

All of us have been impacted by Cancer in some shape or form as it is the second leading cause of death globally. We all have our own story to tell.

Help us make a difference!

A small team of us at BT have committed to collectively walking 500 miles by the end of the financial year (Wednesday 31st March). To put into perspective, this is roughly the distance of London to Iverness (actually a bit more).

Every day thousands of women and girls, all over the world, have no choice but to walk many miles to fetch water for their families. Water that is often dirty.

Their daily routine deprives them of the chance to have an education, a job, and traps them in a cycle of poverty.

Your support can help build wells and water pumps closer to rural communities so that women and girls dont have to spend their days walking for water, and can plan for a better future.
