This is a challenge faced daily for approximately 11.3% of the world's population including children. Every minute, more than five child mortalities can be attributed to malnutrition. For those fortunate to survive, malnutrition has detrimental effects on childhood growth and learning abilities.

Through FAST 24, Lancaster University students will go without food on 27th November to raise money for UNICEF's emergency food programmes.

The United Nation's International Children's Emergency UNICEF is a charity part of the United Nation's Development Group committed to protection of children worldwide. UNICEF provides 80% of the world's life-saving food through its nutrition programmes.
