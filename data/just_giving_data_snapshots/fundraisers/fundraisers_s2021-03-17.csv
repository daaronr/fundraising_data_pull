Living with cancer can be devastating at the best of times, but even harder as a result of the recent pandemic.  At Macmillan, we talk to people affected by cancer every day and for many, issues with money and mental health such as stress and depression, are their biggest worry.

Our partnership focuses on tackling financial hardship and loneliness together, helping Macmillan develop their telephone, online and virtual support services and to help thousands more people with much needed financial and emotional support.

The CBRE partnership is going to be more important than ever before, to help Macmillan do whatever it takes to support every single person living with cancer.

Cancer is not going anywhere.  And neither can Macmillan.

Your small steps will help Guide Dogs make giant leaps. Just one week of stepping can make a difference to the life of children and adults living with sight loss. Raise over £50 (£25 for children) and well replace those worn out socks with a brand-new Guide Dogs pair designed by an international fashion icon!

How your funds will change lives...

-	£50 could pay for fun, tactile activities to help children co-ordinate their muscles and movements.

-	£96 could pay for an eye test each for two guide dogs in training

-	£116 could buy a Training School Kit for one of our guide dog trainers who will teach pups the specialist skills they need as fully qualified guide dogs.

-	£710 could buy a Birthing Kit containing all the essential equipment for a guide dog mum to safely deliver her puppies.

Its thanks to people like you that we can continue to provide life-changing services. So, a huge thank you and lots of luck for your challenge!

There had been signs that something wasn’t quite right for several months prior to this diagnosis but it had never crossed any of our minds that the prognosis would be so devastating.</span></p><p class=""p1"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Due to John’s declining physical abilities, there were no treatment options available and so very quickly we had to come to terms with the fact that this situation was going to have the saddest conclusion. </p><p class=""p1"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">My mum and I were both recovering from COVID-19 at the time but we put everything else to one side and became full-time carers to my Dad. He gradually needed help with all daily tasks and slowly began to do less and eat less. </p><p class=""p1"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><span class=""s1"">A few weeks into the New Year, we came to a stage where we realised we needed some help and that is when the team at Marie Curie came into our lives. Every day they came to see my Dad, to talk to him, wash him and assess his medical needs. He laughed and joked with them most days, but his jovial and comedic personality slowly waned as his energy levels depleted. In some way, the man I called my Dad had already disappeared but we showed him our love every day and did our most to make him comfortable.</span></p><p class=""p1"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">14 weeks after the diagnosis, on 10th March 2021, my Dad restfully fell to sleep for the last time, surrounded by love and peace.</p><p class=""p1"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><span class=""s1"">If it hadn’t have been for those daily visits from the Marie Curie nurses then I don’t know what we would have done. Their input was completely invaluable, and we are still benefitting from their support even though my Dad is no longer with us. </span></p><p class=""p1"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">During our time with Marie Curie, I’ve learnt that around 90% of their staff are volunteers. However, it costs over £19,000 a year for one nurse and £13,000 a year for one Healthcare Assistant, in order to provide the care that is required. Because the charity relies on donations and fundraising, it’s staggering to realise that around 110,000 people every year in the UK do not have the end of life care that is needed. This is so sad and makes me even more thankful that this care and support was made available to us as a family at the very time that we all so desperately needed it.</p><p class=""p1"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><span class=""s1"">We would therefore like to ask you to make a donation to Marie Curie, if you can. There is absolutely no pressure to do so though and we appreciate that times are very uncertain at the moment and that finances may be tight.

It feels like just yesterday I was sat in my room at university glued to my laptop, watching scenes unfold and waiting in anticipation of the success of the revolution and a happier, safer, free Syria.<br/><br/>10 years later, the revolution crushed and civil war has left over 11 million people struggling to survive. There are over 6 million refugees trying to build new lives in other countries, and over 6 million repeatedly displaced inside Syria living in IDP camps, barely surviving as their villages were attacked. Over 2.5 million are children who have never known peace.<br/><br/>I think we all need to understand the plight of the Syrian people better. We need to support them by supporting the work of charities. We need to help promote government policies that welcome refugees, and that put pressure on the Syrian regime to stop targeting civilians and hospitals, and to allow aid to reach those who truly need it.<br/></p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.
