They had the idea to raise money during Valentine’s Day and asked me to help so we came up with the idea that if you do a meal from home whether it’s a dine in for £10 or £12 or you buy different things and make a meal, order a takeaway. You round that up to the nearest 10 and donate that to the BHF this year. So for example, if you do M&amp;S dine in (which I think is £10) you donate £10 to the BHF. If you want to join then you’re more than welcome, or you can just donate every little helps! </span></p>",Virtual Valentines 2021,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Virtual Valentines ,https://www.justgiving.com/Virtual-Valentines2021,/Virtual-Valentines2021,United Kingdom,,Virtual Valentines 2021,//images.justgiving.com/image/51609c99-7aed-4133-9f49-c811f877901f.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,9.982189,Ali Rhodes,We are raising money,It is a charity close to my heart and many others,2021-01-12T15:42:54,183092,6456518,2021-02-14T00:00:00,150,641389,014f9c00-926e-49c2-80ab-51ce142cba6a,British Heart Foundation,183092,225971,183092,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-01-13T06:58:55Z

After diagnosis I had to have a cardiac catheter put in to close up the hole (I have had this tiny piece of metal in my heart for nearly 21 years). Without the research of The British Heart Foundation this may not have been possible.</p><p style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);"">Also, in 2017 my dad at 60 years old had a heart attack and had to have stents fitted. All was well until just over a week later he suffered a cardiac arrest due to scar tissue on the heart due to the stents being fitted (it's very rare!). He was brought back to life by my mum and paramedics and rushed to hospital. But, a day later he suffered another cardiac arrest and was brought back to life..yet again. It was then decided he should have an ICD (Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator) fitted to prevent anymore. It's been nearly three years since all this happened and I am happy to say he is perfectly fine. Yet again without the great research BHF does it could have been a totally different story.</p><p style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);"">So, as you can see British Heart Foundation is a charity very close to my heart and one that I want to give back too.
