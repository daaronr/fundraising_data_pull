This winter may be our toughest yet and I am helping to bring some community spirit by sharing my sparkle by supporting St John. 

St John volunteers treat and transport thousands of patients each year, and in times of crisis we are England's national health reserve.  

During the pandemic our skilled and highly trained volunteers are working long shifts supporting sick people and their families, in hospitals, in ambulances and at home. We are proud to be working alongside the nations ambulance trusts and in hospitals around the country.

""I enjoy helping people and its what I have been training to do. Its very rewarding personally knowing that my colleagues and I are making a difference to peoples lives when they most need it.""

I was one of these special children that was treated at Gosh and I couldn’t be prouder of this. I was diagnosed in 2013 with a rare heart condition that nearly killed me. Great ormond street helped my local hospital and worked along side them to get me better and to a place that I could function properly without being at risk. Visiting Gosh and being treated there for around 3 years was amazing. I got to see hands on the work the amazing staff do and how they care for children who need them, so I wanted to give a little back to them. Not only have they helped me physically I was also supported mentally as this I something I really did and still struggle with. Please help me to raise some funds for a fantastic charity and hospital. </span><br/></p>",Ellington Christmas Lights,0,0,0,0,0,https://images.justgiving.com/image/c56ddf84-1274-403d-b0c4-18191e2e137d.jpg,https://images.justgiving.com/image/c56ddf84-1274-403d-b0c4-18191e2e137d.jpg?template=size150x150face,true,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Ellington Christmas Lights,https://www.justgiving.com/Katie-Jo-Ellington,/Katie-Jo-Ellington,United Kingdom,,Ellington Christmas Lights,//images.justgiving.com/image/f16afc6f-3b6e-440f-9220-14f7d6aa9026.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,27.98014,Katie'Jo Ellington,I am fundraising,This charity has a close place in my heart,2020-12-02T21:23:09,254,6388268,2020-12-01T00:00:00,500,12057,ecca13ce-af04-4d49-bc3e-f6ceb812d670,Great Ormond Street Hospital,254,1160024,254,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2020-12-03T06:16:00Z
