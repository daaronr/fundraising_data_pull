I did not ask for a fee for these talks but simply my expenses to be reimbursed.  Now we are doing everything online, so I have adapted my 'live' presentations to be delivered online using services such as Zoom. So for winter 20/21 I have decided that I will ask clubs to make a donation to WaterAid if they have enjoyed my talk.  <br/>Thank you if you are making a donation. </span><br/></p>",Jay's Inside My Head - photography online presentations,0,0,0,0,0,I am giving online talks to camera clubs because water is a basic need in life.
