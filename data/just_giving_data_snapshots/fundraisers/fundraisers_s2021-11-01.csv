Our partnership focuses on tackling financial hardship and loneliness together, helping Macmillan develop their telephone, online and virtual support services and to help thousands more people with much needed financial and emotional support.

The CBRE partnership is going to be more important than ever before, to help Macmillan do whatever it takes to support every single person living with cancer.

Every little bit helps. Thank you for your support. Below is some information about Macmillan Cancer Support. There’s around 3 million people living with cancer in the UK today, and over 360,000 more are diagnosed every year. Right now, millions of people with cancer are counting on Macmillan for physical, financial and emotional support. At Macmillan, they do whatever it takes – last year was no exception. But they can't do it alone. Macmillan is facing a huge drop in income as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Because 97% of their work is funded by people like us, they need our support now more than ever.

This year I will be running 4 miles everyday throughout November. </p><p>This year has been a difficult one as our Mum went into cardiac arrest in May, my brother Nathan and her partner Geoff ultimately saved her life performing  CPR until the paramedics arrived with the defibrillator. After 2 separate intubation's on ICU and a total of 9 weeks on Coronary Care she was discharged. After undergoing several tests Mum has been diagnosed with Long QT syndrome which is a heart condition that only presents itself when a person goes into cardiac arrest or if you are tested for it because a family member has it. Myself, my sisters, brother and Nephew have all been advised to have tests carried out to make sure none of us have the same condition. Between Lee's diagnosis 41 years ago and now it has become apparent that Long QT is linked with my brothers heart defect. This is why I will continue to fundraise for the BHF so they can continue to make scientific breakthroughs. This challenge won't be easy, the anxiety after nearly losing our Mum has prevented me from running as regularly as I usually do. I also stopped my 10 mile training and didn't participate in the York 10 miler as I was worried it may trigger something. This also meant I couldn't raise money for the BHF. So it's definitely going to be a challenge.</p><p> On reflection I've realised that I need to keep my own heart healthy regardless of the outcome of the tests  I also want to keep Lee's memory alive and continue to contribute to the BHF so their research will hopefully prevent other families suffering at the loss of a loved  one. Let's keep hearts beating ❤ Please donate if you can ❤</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>",Lisa's fundraising page!.,7.50,0,40,40,0,I will be running 4 miles everyday in November! because I want to continue raising money for the BHF,I will be running 4 miles everyday in November!,I want to continue raising money for the BHF,https://images.justgiving.com/image/2d66adb6-29b2-49d9-965f-3bf954f2aefa.jpg,https://images.justgiving.com/image/2d66adb6-29b2-49d9-965f-3bf954f2aefa.jpg?template=size150x150face,NA,NA,Lee Batchelor,NA,915293,Lee Batchelor ,/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/14804246,remember/915293,NA,NA,In memory of Lee Batchelor,https://www.justgiving.com/Lisa-Dillon4,/Lisa-Dillon4,United Kingdom,,Lisa's fundraising page!.,//images.justgiving.com/image/d112776e-49ca-4bff-b782-d3b939d27c64.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,23.001307,Lisa Dillon,2021-10-31T18:50:33,183092,7131206,2021-10-31T18:50:33,100,641389,552f2cf9-1aa5-4a8c-84c3-70b0783a8ef0,I will be running 4 miles everyday in November!,I want to continue raising money for the BHF,British Heart Foundation,183092,225971,183092,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-11-01T23:17:10Z

I want another ‘Casa number 2’ to be trained to support a partnership with another blind or partially sighted person so they can have too what I had. My Casa is no longer working. She supported me for 10 years. At 13 1/2 (as of November 2021), she is happily enjoying a doggy retirement. <span>.</span></li></ul></div><div>I have to admit the scary fact that I will reach half a century myself this month. With this in mind I realise that Casa has been with me for over 1/5 of my life. It seems unbelievable in itself.</div><div><br/></div><div>Casa continues to be the most blessed physical gift I have ever received. I am biased of course, but she has always been the most perfect dog in so many ways. I could go on and on about her working skills but I just want to leave you with these thoughts instead. Casa has been the friend I so desperately needed. My partner, soulmate, best girl, my bed companion, and so so much more. Casa taught me how to love, and to be loved-unconditionally.</div><div><br/></div><div>I totally dread the final day which all dogs must reach but I am thankful for the time I have had with her now in doggy retirement, walking and playing in the park and visiting our favourite cafés.</div><div><br/></div><div>Many of you will know that I have been fundraising for a while now. I had all sorts of plans for the main fundraising just before Covid hit. All my plans;, like the world, went pear shaped!</div><div><br/></div><div>I wondered if I might take the opportunity of my 50th birthday to try and raise a little more towards the fund. I know I am sometimes lucky enough to receive gifts and cards to mark birthday occasions but this fundraising to help somebody else’s life instead is so so much more important. I know some people have already donated previously but if you were going to send me a gift or a card, please think instead about the future of a blind or partially sighted person desperately needing a guide dog and think of it as donating to their lives instead. As I said at the start I have to raise £5000. Just over £1400 has already been raised (including the gratefully received recent birthday donations through Facebook.) The aim here and perhaps to be creative is to suggest £63.50 as a representation of classes and mine combined age but let’s be daring and double it and aim for a £127! Instead</div><div><br/></div><div>Every £1 or £2 which you would have spent on a card with account. Casa (who is currently next to me on my bed fast asleep) I’m sure, with thank you too.</div><div><br/></div><div>Hopefully I will be able to work out how to add a few photos to this. If not, just think of the most beautiful black flat coat retriever cross labrador, with long silky ears, soulful brown eyes, a tail which I call ‘ thumper’ because Casa loves to  wag her tail and literally thump anything or anyone who happens to be near her,. A tail constantly sharing her happiness. I can’t forget one other infamous characteristic: the minute we stop at a cafe or to wait for a bus; her harness would come off and that became the signal to Casa it was time to reverse into the nearest person, friend or stranger and hope her back end would be tickled . Or perhaps even better (or worse); Turning onto her back, tail still working, legs in the air and a very toothy grin all over her face wanting her tummy tickled instead! This  is the Casa I know and love. A happy dog at her best.</div><div><br/></div><div>Do I need to say anymore? except a big thank you. </div><p></p>",Susannah & Casa's a story,3.75,0,35,28,0,"I aim to  raise £5,000 because I want to give ‘Casa 2nd’ to another blind person","I aim to  raise £5,000",I want to give ‘Casa 2nd’ to another blind person,NA,NA,NA,NA,Susannah Barnett ,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Susannah Barnett 's Birthday,https://www.justgiving.com/Susannah-Barnett1,/Susannah-Barnett1,United Kingdom,,Susannah & Casa's a story,//images.justgiving.com/image/a277ccdf-40b4-4d36-94e4-05c5a5d0ab98.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,15.505782,Susannah Barnett,2021-10-29T21:49:22,2261,7127297,2021-11-16T00:00:00,127,12049,58d1c746-52ad-4f58-9798-4c1281e3f9f0,"I aim to  raise £5,000",I want to give ‘Casa 2nd’ to another blind person,Guide Dogs,2261,209617,2261,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-11-01T23:17:10Z

A world with enough support to make the challenges of sight loss no barrier to fulfilling hopes and dreams.</p><p>As a keen animal lover and dog-mum to 2 black labs, I know how special pets are. Guide Dogs gives people a chance to have that super pet but also the ability to profoundly change someone’s life forever. Whenever I see a Guide Dog on duty, it absolutely moves me.</p><p>Any donations, big or small are very gratefully received for this fantastic charity. For sure, it’ll keep me going through the dark and cold nights whilst training! </p><p>All my love</p><p>Sums</p>",Summer's London Marathon 2022 page,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,https://images.justgiving.com/image/6f4194ca-5823-481e-af3b-3a35d50c221a.jpg,https://images.justgiving.com/image/6f4194ca-5823-481e-af3b-3a35d50c221a.jpg?template=size150x150face,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,London Marathon 2022,https://www.justgiving.com/Summer-Gibb,/Summer-Gibb,United Kingdom,,Summer's London Marathon 2022 page,//images.justgiving.com/image/52fdc9d3-f93d-4135-b3ad-4dd0e2b12b38.png?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,11.816355,Summer Gibb,2021-10-27T21:54:47,2261,6202476,2022-10-02T00:00:00,2000,12049,210da25e-1e28-4a57-a6a5-966ad3bdaf9a,NA,NA,Guide Dogs,2261,209617,2261,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-11-01T23:17:10Z

Their beautiful baby girl Molly suffered 5 cardiac arrests and was rushed straight to Great Ormond Street Hospital. They were told to prepare for the worst and every day was touch and go. 2 weeks later they made the decision to turn her life saving machine off to see if her heart would cope and Molly showed her true strength and against all odds proved the doctors wrong and stayed stable! Each day since then she has shown the world what a fighter she is and remains in a stable condition. None of this would have been possible without the outstanding care of the team at GOSH. Cara, Rob and Molly’s future is completely unknown but all we do know is how bloody amazing the three of them are. As a friend it’s truly heartbreaking to hear and not be able to help so that is why I have decided to run the marathon to try and raise as much money as possible for this hospital so they can continue to support the Barbers in every way possible!!
