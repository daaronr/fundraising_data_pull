He was suffering from high output heart failure caused by his hemangioma. He was cared for in the paediatric intensive care unit for 10 days then we were moved onto a ward for the further 7 days before being allowed home. During our time at GOSH, Freddie was cared for by some of the most amazing consultants, doctors, nurses, physio's and specialists. His team worked tirelessly to stabilise his heart and help him adjust to life outside of the womb. I'm taking part in this challenge to run 31 miles in January to say thank you to all of the people who cared for Freddie and supported Jack and I during our time at GOSH. I can not run for toffee and at the moment, probably couldn't even run half a mile! I've also realised the logistics of getting the time to run with 2 young children so decided that Freddie will be doing this with me, albeit from the comfort of his buggy!

Initially I wanted to use this time to improve my fitness and mental health, and as I improved I started taking on more challenges. 12 weeks ago I signed up to a virtual training programme on Zwift which ends just before Christmas. Now, I am aware that this year, for many people, has been incredibly difficult, not least of all for those under going treatment for medical conditions. Many of my closest friends and relatives have been battling cancer throughout this COVID pandemic and I want to recognise that struggle and all their perseverance in the face of adversity. The best way that I know how to do this is through my cycling. Therefore I have decided to put my training to the test and end this year with a 500km cycling challenge. The Rapha #Festive500 takes place every year between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve and participants have to complete 500 kilometres on their bike either outdoors or, as an exception this year, on indoor trainers. </p><p>This will be a distance greater than I have ever cycled in one week, but I am confident that I can do it, with the inspiration of those I know who have completed or only just started their treatment this year. On behalf of all those people supported by this wonderful charity, I hope that you will consider sponsoring me in my efforts. I will provide regular updates throughout the week, and if you’re unable to sponsor me, I will still be very grateful for your words of encouragement!</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

His Alzheimers was fast progressing and very aggressive. <span>After a few long painful years of watching him quickly deteriorate and after him taking a turn for the worst after a seizure at the start of November, we were told by the doctors on the 20th of November that they would be coming to make him comfortable for his last few days. </span></p><p><span>We were having careers come in to help a couple of times a day and they mentioned that Marie Curie nurses could be organised to come and stay over night whilst Rod was having end of life care. This was soon organised and they sorted for somebody to stay for 3 nights. This came as a big relief to me as it meant I could go and get some rest over night knowing that he was in safe hands downstairs and someone was with him at all times. All 3 nights, the nurses phoned at 8 to make sure everything was ok and to even see if i wanted anything brought over! </span><br/></p><p><span>On the 4th night, we knew he was near the end so I phoned to see if someone could come and stay again as I was worried about him passing in the night by himself. The organiser that I spoke to said that we wasn't supposed to have a 4th night but phoned back later to say she had organised for someone to come as she felt sorry for me, all out of the kindness of her heart. As usual, the nurse that was coming phoned me at 8 to make sure everything was ok before she came but his breathing had changed by then. When I told her this, she said that she would be arriving early. At 9 o'clock, Rod sadly passed away surrounded by me and our son and daughter. 15 minutes after he had passed, the marie curie nurse arrived. Instead of leaving, she came in and changed him into his comfy pajamas and made sure he was clean. She then sat with us and comforted us whilst we waited for the doctor and under taker to arrive. She was an absolute God send that night, she kept us calm and stayed with us when she didn't really need to. </span><span>Since Rod has passed, I have even had phone calls and flowers from the nurses.</span></p><p><span>I have chosen to fund raise for Marie Curie because not only did they come to just do their job of sitting with Rod over night, they were a great help and were so kind to me. What they do is absolutely incredible, giving families who are going through so much, some relief and comfort and I would like to give something back to them as I can't thank them enough for what they did for me and my family.</span></p>",In Loving Memory Of Rodney Hammond,66.25,0,335,34,0,NA,NA,true,true,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,In memory of Rodney Hammond,https://www.justgiving.com/Rodney-Hammond,/Rodney-Hammond,United Kingdom,,In Loving Memory Of Rodney Hammond,//images.justgiving.com/image/dd2db9f7-3946-4432-817b-e4554bd43f3e.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,21.493336,Linda Hammond,NA,NA,2020-12-07T19:37:49,50,6396392,2020-12-07T19:37:49,1000,12130,e05cfa16-a512-45ea-a508-afb1b3c30f8f,Marie Curie,50,207994,50,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2020-12-08T06:16:53Z
