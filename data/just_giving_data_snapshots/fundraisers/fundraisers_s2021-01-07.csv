This isn't my first rodeo. Back in 2014 I did my first 24 hour livestream for Macmillan Cancer Support and since then my community has raised over £2000 for a charity that's very close to my heart. I work for Macmillan for 3 1/2 before I made my start in my current career path and the work that they do is simply incredible.<br /><br />After what's been a brutal year for us all, and especially charities, we need to help those who are not only in the world of Covid-19, but are fighting cancer at the same time. I'm here to change that in 2021.<br /><br />On August 28th, 2021 I'll be reinstating our yearly 24 hour livestream event. There'll also be a teaser livestream on Saturday 3rd April, which is the Easter weekend.<br /><br />There’ll be giveaways, challenges, singing, discussion and more.<br /><br />Until then, the donation page is open to donate if you can’t make it on the day. You can also drop by on any livestream before the events to hit the follow button to make sure you’re ready to catch the event, or use the Game Heroes donation link!<br /><br />Roll for Initiative.<br />A&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>",RPG Al3x,0,0,0,0,0,53922849-6e69-4322-addb-a2b7a21e32e5,true,true,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Game Heroes 2020,https://www.justgiving.com/rpg-al-3-x,/rpg-al-3-x,,,RPG Al3x,//images.justgiving.com/image/1a4bb86c-a36f-4a15-9ab3-a4cd2a5e4e71.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,15.924427,Alex Mullings,2021-01-06T10:45:37,2116,5821741,2020-12-31T00:00:00,2000,13507,eaf50b63-2da5-4d90-8b44-8a8f356d42fa,NA,NA,Macmillan Cancer Support,2116,261017,2116,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-01-07T06:21:40Z

These wonderful people brought smiles and laughs every day to those they met. In these difficult times it will be sad that so many people won't be able to say goodbye to my nanna in the way they would have liked. But what we do know is that nanna is now at peace with her beloved ken. I thought long and hard about how i could bring us all together and do something in their memory. So I thought raising a little bit of money for a charity who in some ways helped my grandparents at some point. I understand that times are hard, but any small donation in memory of these special people would mean a lot to our family and of course the charity. Thank you for your kind words and support.  Lets pull together and say goodbye to Sheila in the best way we can. </p>",In memory of Sheila Ayres,11.25,0,88,44,0,NA,NA,NA,Sheila And Ken  Ayres,NA,NA,829694,Sheila  Ayres,/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/13667624,remember/829694,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,In memory of Sheila  Ayres,https://www.justgiving.com/Natalie-Salt2,/Natalie-Salt2,United Kingdom,,In memory of Sheila Ayres,//images.justgiving.com/image/78a842bb-b6c1-4954-a970-33782a4dafed.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,22.9306,Natalie Salt,2021-01-06T19:29:34,183092,6445056,2021-01-06T19:29:34,200,641389,823657a8-7433-4555-8e27-dda3b28d5b22,Pulling together,My grandparents were very close to my heart xx,British Heart Foundation,183092,225971,183092,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-01-07T06:21:40Z

Over the past several months I have watched my team and wider colleagues work tirelessly to try and raise funds to continue the amazing work that The BHF does. Covid 19 has affected everyone, but for the charity sector it has been devastating. There have been many hard moments (and continue to be) including redundancies and income we had worked so hard to secure disappearing overnight. Also looking outside of The BHF to the wider charity sector at former colleagues and friends who have lost jobs. People who work in an industry because they love it and now due to the pandemic and will now struggle to find new roles. </p><p>I have decided therefore to do ‘my bit’ outside of the day job and want to set myself the challenge to run 60k in February, which is National Heart Month as well as The BHF turning 60 in 2021.<span> Having just run my first 5k in 3 years today, this won't be easy, if it was it wouldn't be a challenge! </span></p><p>So, to summarise I am doing this for a few reasons;</p><p>-    Health <br/>-    Keeping sane at a tough time <br/>-    For my BHF North West Team <br/>-    To raise awareness to support the charity sector in general at this tough time</p><p>If anyone could make a donation I would be very grateful. I see daily how the money people give to The BHF changes and saves lives. Without them the world would look very differently, and I am passionate to play my small part to make a difference. If anyone out there would be keen to do something similar for The BHF or another cause close to your heart, I would encourage you to do so. If everyone did something, no matter how small it would make the world of difference. </p><p>Thanks in advance to any support you can offer at a challenging time</p><p>Kat <br/>x<br/></p><p></p>",60K for 60 years of The BHF,117.50,0,550,92,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,https://images.justgiving.com/image/bb97f77f-afc4-4212-8789-2ccf3752f859.jpg,https://images.justgiving.com/image/bb97f77f-afc4-4212-8789-2ccf3752f859.jpg?template=size150x150face,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,KATHERINE RUNS 60K FOR 60 YEARS OF THE BHF,https://www.justgiving.com/KatStybelski,/KatStybelski,United Kingdom,,60K for 60 years of The BHF,//images.justgiving.com/image/e6b71b72-62a5-43e3-9b53-594ccb615307.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,9.970397,Katherine Stybelski,2021-01-06T15:55:28,183092,6445026,2021-02-28T00:00:00,600,641389,1988c990-a680-4254-9a09-62cbd697ef87,I am running,the work we do matters to so many,British Heart Foundation,183092,225971,183092,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-01-07T06:21:40Z

All of us have been impacted by Cancer in some shape or form as it is the second leading cause of death globally. We all have our own story to tell.

Help us make a difference!

A small team of us at BT have committed to collectively walking 500 miles by the end of the financial year (Wednesday 31st March). To put into perspective, this is roughly the distance of London to Iverness (actually a bit more).

If we have more people sign up to join our group, then in true Proclaimers style, we won't be stopping at 500 ...

The Hospice is often very different from what people expect  it is a warm, friendly space with beautiful gardens, delicious home-cooked food and personalised care. Every person is treated as an individual and helped to reach their goals and fulfil their wishes. A team of nurses, doctors, social workers, physiotherapists, chaplains, bereavement counsellors and pharmacists work together, putting every person at the centre of their care.  Throughout Covid-19 Bradford Hospice teams have been working around the clock to continue supporting local people. Death, dying and bereavement is at the forefront of peoples minds and Marie Curie knows what a difference the right care at the end of life can make.   They cant do any of this without your support. Thank you for your generous donation which supports the Bradford Hospice and Marie Curie care.</p><p>  Personally my mother was cared for there and was treated with much kindness and respect.  I will be 80 when I do this Trek and I continue to train and keep fit for it.  At this very difficult time during the Covid Pandemic it is so difficult to raise money for the Hospice.  Please consider donating to this great cause.</p>",liz's page,0,0,0,0,0,0b7488b8-cf0a-4f28-81f7-e6520ece1445,true,true,NA,https://images.justgiving.com/image/6e09a671-01c2-4140-a590-a1195e46ef83.jpg,https://images.justgiving.com/image/6e09a671-01c2-4140-a590-a1195e46ef83.jpg?template=size150x150face,829764,Ruby Wood,/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/13667579,remember/829764,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Great Daffodil Appeal Virtual Collections 2021,https://www.justgiving.com/liz-Madden4,/liz-Madden4,United Kingdom,,liz's page,//images.justgiving.com/image/b7aa86aa-2d8d-40c1-aff0-9368f7ee087b.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,9.563668,liz Madden,2021-01-06T22:50:01,50,6293069,2021-02-01T00:00:00,0,279240,ef5fc630-5ea0-4d91-8934-06321b912879,NA,NA,Marie Curie,50,207994,50,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-01-07T06:21:40Z

These include yoga, exercise classes and relaxation.

A team of nurses, doctors, social workers, physiotherapists, chaplains, bereavement counsellors and pharmacists work together, putting every person at the centre of their care.
