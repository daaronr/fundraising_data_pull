Crisps are actually my worst downfall more so than chocolate so will definitely be a struggle. Beechy my partner will also be joining me on this challenge.

He underwent a number of life saving heart operations and this allowed us to have so many more years with him, which makes the British Heart Foundation a charity close to our hearts (excuse the pun). If you know me you know I LOVE chocolate, and anything chocolate flavoured is my first choice, if I can include it for breakfast, lunch and dinner (and in between) I will! SO while to some this may seem an easy challenge for me, who has been comfort eating my way through the last year on anything chocolate related, this is going to be really hard (I don't remember going a day without it) ... and let's face it my knees would never stand up to a sponsored run! Hopefully at the end of the month I will also have a healthier heart!

Their research has meant that both my grandad and my dad have both managed to spend more time with loved ones. Most of you won't know in April 2021 my dad suffered a severe cardiac arrest and the outlook wasn't good and we were told to prepare for the worst. Thankfully my dad pulled through and after some time in intensive care he started to make improvements day by day. He was fitted with a defibrillator and the genetics testing started. It's thanks to research from the BHF that my sister and I were able to get heart scans while we waited to find out if dad could have passed his heart disease to us and we to our kids. Thankfully all results showed it isn't genetic and dad having a defibrillator fitted means he can pretty much live a normal life. Covid has meant that the BHF has lost of funding and therefore I have decided to support them by doing dechox. Giving up chocolate, cakes and sweets is not easy! But it's certainly worth it for the amazing work this charity does. Thank you for taking time to read my story, say a prayer for my husband Ant and any donations are great appreciated.

It is my one true love, my achilles heel, my weak point. Not a glass of wine on a Friday night, or a virtual shopping trip. It's the gooeyyyest brownies, the super yum cookies, doughnuts, the large bar of choc that gets me the most. Especially during the past year. </p><p><span>I've been doing some research on sugar and the science behind what sugar does to your body. It seems that we're all slightly addicted (or worse) because it is basically in everything we eat that can be bought from a box or a packet. I want to set the reset button and see if it can make a difference to the way I feel. I got to a point around 2 years ago when my mental health was at its lowest, where I ate sugar such as chocolate instead of meals. As I have been exploring going booze-free when possible and not smoking when </span>socialising<span>, sugar has stepped up to fill those gaps. To summarise...this is a big challenge for me. </span></p><p><span>We sadly lost our Nan recently and although she had a great and full life, she also suffered with heart related issues, she had two strokes and diabetes. To be honest it kinda seems ironic doing this challenge in her memory as she was the biggest cake and biscuit lover of all! But, I think she would have liked the sentiment and I'd really like to raise some money for the charity to honour her and all she did for us during her lifetime. We called her 'Nanny Daniel'. She was my mum's mum and she was a modest, headstrong and </span>independent<span> woman. She always laughed and smiled when you chatted to her. In her later years, she didn't talk too much and I'm not sure if this was related to the strokes she had. Or maybe it was due to a kind of contentment you reach later on in life. When I was young she would take me and my 567 other cousins on the train to the beach and I have no idea why she did that because there were so many of us - it must have been a nightmare haha. She would often go on train trips with our G</span>randad and <span>bring me back a paper bag of my favourite sweets, 'toothbrushes and teeth'. Oh the nostalgia! And again, the irony. </span></p><p><span>As much as I love-d sweets, at the age of 29, I'd like to try something new. For my health and to celebrate the life of our beloved Nanny Daniel, I'm giving up the sweet stuff for 30 days. I'm going to be removing refined sugar from my diet as much as possible, whilst allowing myself small amounts of natural sugar from fruits. </span><br/></p><p>Things I will not be eating / drinking (and for each thing there is a £5 penalty): c<span>hocolate, sweets, cake of any form (doughnuts, cookies, biscuits), fizzy drinks, alcohol, anything that has an obvious amount of refined sugar! I will allow myself bread but will be mindful with how much I eat.</span></p><p><span>And if you've got this far - thank you for your support!</span></p><p><span>Bex </span></p><p><span>x </span><br/></p><p><span>PS please always Gift Aid :) - the charity can claim back 25% of your donation from tax you have paid at no cost to you! It's a no-brainer. </span></p><p><br/></p><p>A lil bit from the British Heart Foundation:</p><p><span>The pandemic is the biggest challenge we've faced in our 60 year history.

We work for Which? and we are fundraising for the British Heart Foundation in memory of our friend and colleague Sarah Price, who passed away suddenly last year at the age of 39. 

Sarah was a wonderful person; she excelled in her job but was also a committed team-player, going to great lengths to help her team members day-in, day-out. She was a brilliant friend: funny and kind, someone who always made time for everyone she encountered.

We continue to miss her greatly. 

Sarah was a big fan of Welsh rugby and so we are planning to run, walk or cycle a combined distance that will stretch from our Bristol office, where Sarah worked, to the Principality Stadium in Cardiff and back again, which is around 86 miles in total. We plan to do this over the weekend of 27 - 28 February 2021, being the weekend closest to both St. David's Day and Sarah's 5-year anniversary since she started at Which?.

Each participant will undertake 5km, either walking, running or cycling, to help us get to the total distance. 

The BHF has helped halve the number of people dying from heart and circulatory disease in the UK but sadly every day hundreds of people lose their lives. It's only thanks to donations that the BHF can create new treatments and discover new cures. £24 could pay for two hours of research by an early career scientist, but every pound helps so please give what you can to help us hit our target.

Personally, I lost my fabulous father-in-law 2 years ago and the more we can learn about this horrific disease the better. Every charity needs extra support now, thanks to the lack of fundraising being able to take place during the pandemic, so this is our small way to aid them and support the amazing work these charities do.

It gave us a goal to work towards during the current lockdown and during the process thought we could try and raise a bit of money for charity. We have chosen cancer research as it has in some way shape or form had an impact on most people’s lives.

We need to raise £8,311 per day to run the hospice, so every penny counts. Thank you for helping to make sure more people with a terminal illness in Cardiff and the Vale get the care and support they need.

WaterAid is a charity dedicated to making access to clean water normal for everyone, everywhere. Millions of women and children around the world walk long distances each day to the water source for their families to survive. For me to make a living, I have to endure a sitting position for hours for most days in a week however I can enjoy the luxury of drinkable water, a working toilet and a hot shower whenever I want! But around the world 1 in 10 people have no choice but to drink dirty water, often from remote sources, risking their health, their safety and their chances in life. With clean water, people have an equal chance to be healthy, educated, financially secure, and Communities can thrive.</p><p>I encourage you to support WaterAid monthly, but if that's too much, here is the deal: I found out about the Walk for Water challenge last minute but I'm ready to roll! My target is to walk 12 km each day in March. Following your stunning support in 2020, I believe you will join me in this quest too, even if it's just a single small donation for WaterAid!<br /></p>",NA,NA,Kaska walks for WaterAid,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,bd092236-03f5-4cbf-8ca1-f8486114a1ef,NA,NA,NA,NA,Walk for Water 2021,https://www.justgiving.com/kaska2021,/kaska2021,United Kingdom,...Kaska walks for <strong>WaterAid</strong>...,Kaska walks for WaterAid,//images.justgiving.com/image/0cbd149c-ceca-412b-a32f-f2b95ff03c4c.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,42.18641,Kaska Ziolkowska,2021-02-28T19:01:48,54697,6420578,2021-03-01T00:00:00,500,56780,877d599e-daf3-4a83-b467-42e896fa5edf,I'm walking 12 km every day in March,clean water should be a norm for everyone,WaterAid,54697,288701,54697,Global poverty,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2021-03-01T07:06:40Z
