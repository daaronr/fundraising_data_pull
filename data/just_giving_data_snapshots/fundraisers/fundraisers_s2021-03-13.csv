Living with cancer can be devastating at the best of times, but even harder as a result of the recent pandemic.  At Macmillan, we talk to people affected by cancer every day and for many, issues with money and mental health such as stress and depression, are their biggest worry.

Our partnership focuses on tackling financial hardship and loneliness together, helping Macmillan develop their telephone, online and virtual support services and to help thousands more people with much needed financial and emotional support.

The CBRE partnership is going to be more important than ever before, to help Macmillan do whatever it takes to support every single person living with cancer.

Thanks for visiting our page. We are raising money for the British Heart Foundation and we'd be so grateful for your support. The BHF has helped halve the number of people dying from heart and circulatory disease in the UK but sadly every day hundreds of people lose their lives. It's only thanks to support from people like us that the BHF can create new treatments and discover new cures. £24 could pay for two hours of research by an early career scientist, but every pound helps so please give what you can to help us hit our target.

We work for a world where people with sight loss are never left out of life. We work for a world where blind people no longer feel invisible, where the quality of their eye sight is genuinely the only difference between them and the rest of society. 

A world with enough support to make the challenges of sight loss no barrier to fulfilling your needs and dreams. A world where being blind or partially sighted isn't what defines you.
