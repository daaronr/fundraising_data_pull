My interest started when we were coming back from visiting my Grandad and then I saw a St John Ambulance. I questioned what it was and my dad told me it was a St John Ambulance. This is when we discovered that they do cadet training.I thought, &#34;sign me up!</p><p>All of St John Ambulance's charitable work is entirely funded by donations which is why we have decided to plan an event and raise money that will contribute to help support communities and help save people's lives. </p><p><br/></p><p>When I put the cadet uniform on I will help make a difference. Can you help me make that difference?</p><p><br/></p><p><span>As a charity with a long history of serving humanity, we are proud of our past, our role in the pandemic and excited about creating a healthier, safer, brighter and more resilient future.This winter may be our toughest yet and I am helping to bring some community spirit by sharing my sparkle by supporting St John. St John volunteers treat and transport thousands of patients each year, and in times of crisis we are England's national health reserve.  During the pandemic our skilled and highly trained volunteers are working long shifts supporting sick people and their families, in hospitals, in ambulances and at home. We are proud to be working alongside the nations ambulance trusts and in hospitals around the country.&#34;I enjoy helping people and its what I have been training to do. Its very rewarding personally knowing that my colleagues and I are making a difference to peoples lives when they most need it.&#34; Tom Willis, volunteer Will you support me and help make a difference?</span><br/></p>",Sparkling for St John,0,0,0,0,0,i am holding a charity tradmillathon event because this charity relies solely on donations,i am holding a charity tradmillathon event,this charity relies solely on donations,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,83f4ea48-7777-43f6-a1b7-5793860fca05,NA,Treadmillathon,https://www.justgiving.com/Sarah-HolmesandJamie-Douglas,/Sarah-HolmesandJamie-Douglas,United Kingdom,...Sparkling for <strong>St</strong> <strong>John</strong>...,Sparkling for St John,//images.justgiving.com/image/8a7554ab-4111-4125-859b-c8d9caa5f8c0.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,22.347992,Sarah Holmes,2021-03-02T18:46:35,11205,6558006,2021-04-10T00:00:00,100,13275,d07f3db3-fc1d-4476-b5b3-d02d4cc01d6b,i am holding a charity tradmillathon event,this charity relies solely on donations,St John Ambulance,11205,1077265,11205,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-03-03T07:04:45Z

At Amplify, we are committed to giving back to our community and raising money for the causes that matter most. In 2021, we continue to challenge ourselves, and strive to support charities that need our help.

In turn, our team is taking the plunge and skydiving to save lives. In May, 14 brave team members will take part in a 12,000 feet tandem skydive to raise money for Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH).

GOSH is an international centre of excellence in child healthcare. The hospital receives almost 238,000 outpatient and more than 43,000 inpatient visits every year, and offers the UK’s widest range of specialist health services for children on one site; as well as leading the way in research and development.

Please help our team raise a grand total of £5,530 by donating whatever you can today. We thank you in advance for your support and look forward to sharing our fundraising journey with you!</p>",Igor’s page,0,0,37,9,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ad9b4654-beb7-4f54-aa47-ff17e9399e2a,NA,GemmaHarvey,NA,NA,Amplify Marketing Team Skydive,https://www.justgiving.com/igorsskydive,/igorsskydive,,,Igor’s page,//images.justgiving.com/image/d3dd7fc4-567c-4d60-b709-3e11e850c7d7.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,11.862821,Igor Filipov,2021-03-02T19:17:05,254,6556889,2021-05-14T11:00:00,395,12057,0542103a-e59f-4e0b-8228-acf482c8bb6e,NA,NA,Great Ormond Street Hospital,254,1160024,254,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-03-03T07:04:45Z

When dad was first diagnosed, I felt like my insides had been ripped out, it was a real gut-wrenching moment. He was a single parent and brought us up on his own, so we were all really close. Dad was a really active, sociable man and never viewed himself as an elderly person. When Marie Curie was first mentioned dad wasn't keen and I must admit I also thought that's where you go to die. But he was there for about four weeks and I can honestly say Marie Curie gave us our dad back. That was just the best thing ever - he had no distress and we knew they were taking such good care of him.

Unicef has the knowledge and systems needed to succeed in ensuring all countries have equal access to the Covid vaccine.  <br/><br/>As the largest vaccine buyer in the world, with a vast country presence and decades of experience in supplying and preparing countries and communities for immunisation programmes, UNICEF will play a critical role in the rollout of COVID 19 vaccines through COVAX, catalysing a global recovery. COVAX is the vaccines element of ACT-A. Led by Gavi, the Global Vaccine Alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and World Health Organisation (WHO), it aims to accelerate the development and manufacture of Covid-19 vaccines, and to guarantee fair and equitable access globally. </p><p>Unicef is leading the procurement and supply of COVID-19 vaccines—as well as freight, logistics and storage—for 92 low-and middle-income countries, and a buffer stockpile for humanitarian emergencies. This will be supported by donor funds. UNICEF will also support procurement by 98 higher-income economies who will finance the vaccines from their own public finance budgets. In parallel, UNICEF is working to secure access to safe injection equipment and cold chain equipment, to support a rapid rollout of COVID-19 vaccines.<br/><br/><b>Why Justgiving?</b><br/>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.
