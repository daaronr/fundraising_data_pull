Every little bit helps. Thank you for your support. Below is some information about Macmillan Cancer Support. There’s around 3 million people living with cancer in the UK today, and over 360,000 more are diagnosed every year. Right now, millions of people with cancer are counting on Macmillan for physical, financial and emotional support. At Macmillan, they do whatever it takes – last year was no exception. But they can't do it alone. Macmillan is facing a huge drop in income as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Because 97% of their work is funded by people like us, they need our support now more than ever.

I found this hard, especially in bad weather, but very therapeutic and In memory of my wee Mum, I have decided to continue my walk into November and use it to fundraise for the BHF. I would be very grateful for any amount you could kindly donate, however small,  knowing this may help save others in the future. We also lost my Dad to a heart attack, who passed  at a very young age therefore it is vitally important to support this cause to save others. Please note I will post updates regularly on my Facebook page. </p><p><span>The BHF has helped halve the number of people dying from heart and circulatory disease in the UK but sadly every day hundreds of people lose their lives. It's only thanks to support from people like us that the BHF can create new treatments and discover new cures. £24 could pay for two hours of research by an early career scientist, but every pound helps so please give what you can to help me hit my target.

This is the term for when the skull fuses together prematurely, before brain growth. My skull was fixed in a ridge at the top, which meant it had none of the flexibility of a normal newborn's skull. There was a likelihood that I would be brain-damaged, and have both sight and hearing impairments. Luckily, I was a Caesarian birth (because of complications at the birth of my older brother). This ended up being a blessing in disguise: if I had travelled down the birth canal, my bones wouldn't have crossed over, meaning that my eye sockets would probably have been crushed, and my nose and forehead would have collapsed.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span style=""color: #000000;background-color: transparent;"">A brain scan showed that my brain had luckily not been damaged and it would grow normally. After three months of tests it was also clear that I had no hearing or sight defects. However my parents were still stuck with the decision of what to do about the shape of my head. It looked fine as a baby - a little pointed; but as I grew it would grow too, and because of the fusion, it would grow abnormally. At 5 months old I spent a week in Great Ormond Street Hospital (one of two places in the country that specialise in Craniosynostosis) to undergo an operation which consisted of cutting across from ear to ear so that the whole chunk of bone that was fused could be cut through, and then the front and back would be pushed together to rebuild the part that had been fused. I went for consistent check ups up until the age of 18 months - which is when my parents were told that, other than the scar going across the length of my head, I will be fine. All thanks to the amazing work from the doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span style=""color: #000000;background-color: transparent;"">I’m running the London Landmarks Half Marathon on April 3rd in aid of The Great Ormond Street Hospital Charity, an extraordinary hospital which has always depended on charitable support to give seriously ill children the best chance to fulfil their potential.

The amazing staff who took care of Louie and in particular a surgeon by the name of Paolo De Coppi is the reason I’d like to help raise money so as this amazing facility can help to take care of the children in need. <br/><br/>My brother Louie suffered a severe case of septicaemia and because of Great Ormond Street we can thank them for the reason that he is still here today.<br/><br/>Thank you for your support. I've included information about Great Ormond Street Hospital and Children's Charity below. <br/><br/>Every day brings new challenges at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH). Every day, 619 children and young people from across the UK arrive for life-changing treatments. <br/><br/>Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity raises money to enable the hospital to provide world class care and to pioneer new treatments and cures for childhood illnesses.<br/><br/>Any donation is greatly appreciated xx<br/></p><p><span>Ps </span><span>This is the same fundraiser as the one on my Facebook page!!</span><br/></p>",Lily's 500 000 steps in November for GOSH,78.75,0,405,405,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,500 000 steps in November for GOSH,https://www.justgiving.com/Lily-Thompson6,/Lily-Thompson6,United Kingdom,,Lily's 500 000 steps in November for GOSH,//images.justgiving.com/image/013213e3-44ff-40e6-b13d-0999dbd99855.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,28.21841,Lily Thompson,2021-11-04T21:36:28,254,7142790,2021-11-01T00:00:00,100,12057,83f3f7c7-b723-484d-a3b2-c8cb29de90cf,NA,NA,Great Ormond Street Hospital,254,1160024,254,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-11-08T17:31:44Z

We have decided to run for 3 separate charities that are close to our hearts. </p><p>I have decided to run for Great Ormond Street Hospital, a hospital that treats childhood illnesses. The hospital receives over 230,000 outpatient visits and over 40,000 inpatient visits annually. This world-class hospital helps find new treatments through continuous research. </p><p><span>This run is in memory of my beautiful friend Addie Brady, who sadly lost her battle to a brain tumour in 2018. </span><br/></p><p><span></span></p><p style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">In 2011, Addie was diagnosed with a rare form of bone cancer called spindle cell sarcoma. She underwent surgery that removed her tibia bone and was replaced with a titanium metal. All was well and Addie continued with her life, grateful for things getting back to normal.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p><p style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">However, in 2016 when Addie was at a family party she appeared to be in a trance like state. This was followed by a number of seizures in the ambulance whilst she was being rushed to hospital. From there, she was transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital to discover an aggressive, high grade, inoperable tumour. To everyone’s surprise this was unrelated to the first cancer. Addie was diagnosed Li-Fraumeni Sydnrome also known as LFS, an inherited familial predisposition. LFS occurs due to a mutation in a tumour suppressor gene called TP53. Addie was given 12-18 months to live. Despite Addie and her family’s urge to find more extensive treatment, there was nothing in or outside the UK.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p><p style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Addie underwent radiotherapy and chemotherapy and remained stable for just over a year. However, it became aggressive very quickly. After more scans, they found that the tumour had spread to her spine. This took over her mobility, sight and mind.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p><p style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Addie unfortunately passed away on 1<sup>st</sup><span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span>February 2018 in her home at the age of 16.</p><p style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Addie was the most extraordinary, beautiful, crazy and loving girl. She is loved and missed by everyone everyday. Her laugh was infectious and her smile lit up the room. Memories I made with Addie will never leave, I do not know anyone that made me laugh as much as she did. I am so thankful that she came into my life and had such a great impact, as she did with everyone that she met. </p><p style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Through fundraising for this run, it will help other people like Addie.

Half of those who drown never intend on entering the water. These are wasted lives; preventable deaths. And this needs to change.The RNLI is the charity that saves lives at sea. Last year, brave volunteer crew across Scotland launched to the rescue of people in danger 1,071 times; thats 3 launches each and every day of the year. Why? Because RNLI lifeboat crews are determined to save every one.As a charity, the RNLI receives no government funding and needs to raise an average £155,000 per year to run just one lifeboat station each year. With 46 lifeboat stations in Scotland, the RNLI needs our support to power its lifesaving service.</span></p>",RNLI Islay Fundraising St. Andrews Day Raffle 2021,0,0,420,168,0,The Islay RNLI Fundraisers are raising funds because our volunteers are saving lives every day.,The Islay RNLI Fundraisers are raising funds,our volunteers are saving lives every day.,NA,NA,NA,NA,0178fe3a-3198-4ea0-8868-5e65567da336,NA,NA,NA,RNLI Islay Fundraising Raffle 2021,https://www.justgiving.com/RNLI-Islay-Raffle-2021,/RNLI-Islay-Raffle-2021,United Kingdom,...<strong>RNLI</strong> Islay Fundraising St. Andrews Day Raffle 2021...,RNLI Islay Fundraising St. Andrews Day Raffle 2021,//images.justgiving.com/image/e5d46585-59da-487a-9b24-13d7c0434702.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,65.97008,Islay Raffle Fundraising ,2021-11-05T12:54:00,11200,7143749,2021-11-05T12:54:00,250,13270,eaea378f-a87e-41eb-a67b-025137a5fd22,The Islay RNLI Fundraisers are raising funds,our volunteers are saving lives every day.,RNLI - Royal National Lifeboat Institution,11200,209603,11200,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-11-08T17:31:44Z

The community of Looe, his family and friends , have lost a diamond, wonderful friend, a  fishermen of the Cornish sea. Mick was a kind,  gentleman and made any person feel comfortable in his presence. His patience and wisdom teaching beginners and helping keen fishermen to reel in their catch and bait up always came with wise words of how to catch the &#34;big one&#34; along with lots of banter allowing each person on the boat feeling confident the next bite was the catch of the day. An experienced fishing mentor who shared many stories and experiences with the next person.</span></p><p>As beautiful as any flower can be, there's no color, or big enough size of flower to personify Mick's passing, so we have decided to raise funds and collect donations to go towards the RNLI  fund so Mick's legendary life can live on and continue to be remembered and celebrated. By donating towards the RNLI fund  we will continue to support all the wonderful traits Mick displayed and believed in. To help your fellow man, to be safe at sea, to enjoy and appreciate the wonderful ocean with respect of it's natural force. To be kind, caring and to share what the beauty of the ocean can give to man.

The lifeboat was named after a popular local teenager Ollie Naismith who sadly died in a tragic road traffic accident in 2009. Ollies parents, Maxine and John Naismith spearheaded a fundraising campaign to raise the funds for the lifeboat which has gone on to save many lives in and around Looe including the life of Louis Webber, a young local lad who was of a similar age to Ollie. The lifeboat is now coming to the end of its operational life so the team at Looe Lifeboat station are teaming up with the Naismiths and Webber family to launch the Looe Lifeboat Appeal to raise the £78,000 required to provide a replacement lifeboat which will be named the Ollie Naismith II.Your donation to this community appeal will help to fund this lifeboat which will continue the selfless work of our volunteer lifeboat crew in Looe.</span><br/></p>",In Loving memory of Micky,12.50,0,60,0,0,Raising money for the new Looe Lifeboat because It was a cause that meant a lot to Micky.,Raising money for the new Looe Lifeboat,It was a cause that meant a lot to Micky.,916759,Mick Hood,/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/14825428,remember/916759,3b8ff11c-ca1f-4502-9bcd-8ac34aada7e2,NA,NA,NA,In Memory of Micky,https://www.justgiving.com/MickyLooe,/MickyLooe,United Kingdom,,In Loving memory of Micky,//images.justgiving.com/image/acc9f310-80c6-4e6d-959a-405fbc727057.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,45.836853,Micky Hood,2021-11-07T10:56:28,11200,7147739,2021-11-07T00:00:00,0,13270,27a08e0d-050d-4645-9f35-85c7382d717b,Raising money for the new Looe Lifeboat,It was a cause that meant a lot to Micky.,RNLI - Royal National Lifeboat Institution,11200,209603,11200,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-11-08T17:31:44Z
