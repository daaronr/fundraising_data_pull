When Mum passed away in August, it had subsequently spread to her lymph nodes, lungs, liver and bone. In Mum’s months of illness she had several operations, immunotherapy and care in both Whiston and St Helens Hospitals and Nobles Hospital, Isle of Man. Mum’s care was significantly impacted by Covid-19, and she missed out on important and potentially life-saving treatment as a result. It also meant she had to endure times travelling and in hospital in the UK alone, due to visiting and travel restrictions in place. Mum’s consultant from Clatterbridge Hospital described her cancer as the “worst case he had ever seen”.</p><p>Our lives have been left with a massive void, as our Mum is irreplaceable. She was an exceptionally kind, loving, warm-hearted, generous, selfless woman. Mum was a great advocate for others in her roles in education, the charitable sector and the local Manx community. Her sense of humour is greatly missed, and played a major part in the strength she showed with her illness. No day is the same now she has gone, and we continue to miss her living life with us.  We are hoping to complete the walk on the 1st June 2021, which would have been Mum’s 63rd birthday.</p><p><span>Macmillan offered Mum invaluable support over the phone when she was an inpatient at Whiston Hospital and she rated the advice they gave her highly. It is estimated that the Covid -19 pandemic could lead to a further 35,000 deaths from Cancer. We want to support the good work Macmillan do. Walking from Hunstanton to Mundesley will be no easy feat for us, but we want to raise awareness and funds for Macmillan. </span></p><p><span>Please do sponsor us and thank you for visiting our page. </span><br/></p><p><span>Catherine, Emily and Ryan x </span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>At Macmillan, we give people with cancer everything we’ve got.

They were there when as a young woman I felt lonely and desperate. The second person is my amazing Dad, my best friend, guide and advisor and an exceptional Father. He died in 2013 of cancer, he died with dignity and never complained. He missed out on seeing his Great Grandchildren whom he would have adored. The last person I am walking in memory of is my lovely Father-In-Law, Ken, you couldn't help but love him, he always had a smile and a famous whistle. Another great man who never complained.

We're taking part in Marie Curie’s Step into Spring 2021 Challenge and will be walking 10,000 steps every day in March to raise money for this amazing charity. We will never forget the support and care they gave to our wonderful Grandma Pat and to us during her final months. We can never thank enough the nurses who spent the night in an uncomfortable arm chair, keeping our Pat company whilst awake and safe while she slept. By doing this, they not only gave Gail, Michael and Susan a break, but they also allowed Pat to stay in her own home for much longer. Any donations would be greatly appreciated to enable them to carry on helping other families like they did ours♥ <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Every day of your life matters from the first to the last.

2021 is a vital year in the global campaign to make our world one without malaria. This coming June, the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and the vitally important Kigali Summit on malaria and neglected tropical diseases will take place in Rwanda. The summit marks a historic moment that will unite global leaders and put a spotlight on the importance of renewed action in fighting malaria. We need more action, more innovation, more funding and more political leadership to defeat malaria and move forward stronger in this new global health landscape.

Across Rentokil Initial, colleagues are taking part in a 9,000km Race to Kigali (the distance between our HQ and Kigali, Rwanda), including teams from America, Australia, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Caribbean, Africa, HR, IT, Finance, M&A and Legal. By combining the efforts of colleagues walking, running or cycling, each team will ‘reach’ the distance to Kigali.  This is our global effort to raise funds and show our support for this vital cause.  It all starts on Monday 15 February through to the UN’s World Malaria Day on 25 April.

Andy Ransom: ""As a proud patron of Malaria No More UK, I am asking my colleagues at Rentokil Initial, as well as friends, family and associates to get involved in the Race to Kigali. In doing so, helping raise incredibly important funding for Malaria No More UK at such a critical time. Rentokil Initial Cares, our charitable fund, will match every £1 raised up to £100,000.”  

Together we can achieve a Zero Malaria world within a generation.

2021 is a vital year in the global campaign to make our world one without malaria. This coming June, the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and the vitally important Kigali Summit on malaria and neglected tropical diseases will take place in Rwanda. The summit marks a historic moment that will unite global leaders and put a spotlight on the importance of renewed action in fighting malaria. We need more action, more innovation, more funding and more political leadership to defeat malaria and move forward stronger in this new global health landscape.

Across Rentokil Initial, colleagues are taking part in a 9,000km Race to Kigali (the distance between our HQ and Kigali, Rwanda), including teams from America, Australia, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Caribbean, Africa, HR, IT, Finance, M&A and Legal. By combining the efforts of colleagues walking, running or cycling, each team will ‘reach’ the distance to Kigali.  This is our global effort to raise funds and show our support for this vital cause.  It all starts on Monday 15 February through to the UN’s World Malaria Day on 25 April.

Andy Ransom: ""As a proud patron of Malaria No More UK, I am asking my colleagues at Rentokil Initial, as well as friends, family and associates to get involved in the Race to Kigali. In doing so, helping raise incredibly important funding for Malaria No More UK at such a critical time. Rentokil Initial Cares, our charitable fund, will match every £1 raised up to £100,000.”  

Together we can achieve a Zero Malaria world within a generation.

Please show your support.</p>",Pest Effort,25,0,100,10,0,https://images.justgiving.com/image/57325ab2-4d9b-4d6e-9ef8-7a412715ee4b.jpg,https://images.justgiving.com/image/57325ab2-4d9b-4d6e-9ef8-7a412715ee4b.jpg?template=size150x150face,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,a35f55a7-33d9-431f-8a74-f808eee69cd7,RIRaceToKigali,NA,NA,NA,NA,Rentokil Initial Race to Kigali 2021,https://www.justgiving.com/PestEffort,/PestEffort,,,Pest Effort,//images.justgiving.com/image/56f49564-443e-454a-a8a8-700fe31727fd.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,36.73774,Pest Efforts,2021-02-22T11:17:47,186165,6535694,2021-02-22T11:17:01,1000,1406754,ae89d459-8098-4b3b-906d-473186cd3c4b,NA,NA,Malaria No More,186165,1126222,186165,Global poverty,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2021-02-23T07:06:14Z
