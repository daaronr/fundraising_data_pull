This challenge was invented by David Goggins. Goggins is an ex-Navy Seal and the only seal in history to do hell week 3 times. He does this every year as to raise awareness of one's mental and physical capabilities. His aim is to show us what we are capable of, if we put our minds to it. I was inspired by his message and thought, as I am stuck in lockdown, why not push myself to see how far I can physically and mentally go. </p><p>The challenge entails running 4 miles (6.4km) every 4 hours for 48 hours. That's a cumulative mileage of 76km in 48hrs. Now, as somewhat of a mediocre runner myself, I thought this looked very hard but something worth attempting. I am training for just under 3 weeks for this and planning on starting at 12:00pm the 6th March and finishing at 8:00am on the 8th March. After a lot of research, I have concluded that the sleep deprivation combined with the serious muscle fatigue will really test me; but I am willing to accept the challenge.</p><p>I will attempt to do as much as I can unless injury or incapability prevents me. I want to prove to myself that we can do more than we think we are capable of and our minds can push us through severe discomfort in life.</p><p>I would greatly appreciate any donations, to a great charity and a charity that saved my eyesight when I was very young. I would not be able to do many things today, without the amazing cataract surgery I received. </p><p>I sincerely hope I can finish this challenge and make both myself and the charity proud.</p>",NA,NA,Edward's 4x4x48 run,75,0,460,61,0,NA,NA,true,NA,NA,NA,NA,4x4x48 run,https://www.justgiving.com/Edward-Crowe4,/Edward-Crowe4,United Kingdom,,Edward's 4x4x48 run,//images.justgiving.com/image/7c37b49c-8633-46f9-b50e-1de45aaed346.png?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,18.661987,Edward Crowe,2021-02-21T14:53:31,254,6535196,2021-03-06T00:00:00,750,12057,70c6c465-5985-459f-8918-6ee44d703d7d,I am attempting the David Goggins 4x4x48 challenge,I want to thank the charity that saved my eyesight,Great Ormond Street Hospital,254,1160024,254,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-02-22T07:02:35Z
