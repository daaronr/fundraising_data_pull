Graham Williams (Taid) was the epicentre of our small family, and was someone who brought smiles and joy to everyone he met. No matter where we went, whether just to the cricket or to a fancy restaurant he would stand and talk to complete strangers and bring a smile to their face with a little joke or just his kind hearted nature. He was unquestionably liked and loved by everyone who knew him whether it was for a day, a year or a lifetime in our case. </p><p>The past year has been a difficult one for many people with COVID and for us as a family it has been the cruelest of circumstances with restrictions keeping us apart with such little time to spare with our Taid. Towards the end we got to spend a little time with him and he bravely fought his fight with Cancer right to the end. </p><p>The care he got from Macmillan and other Nurses throughout the last few weeks of his life was truly exceptional. They were there to help him at all hours of the day and through the night and my grandma was very thankful for their wonderful support. </p><p>SO to the Fundraising!! </p><p>In memory of our Taid and as a thank you to Macmillan for the brilliant work they do we decided to try to do some fundraising by running/walking a certain distance in March. After speaking to a couple of friends about it, within an hour we had 13 other of our friends and family wanting to join us and help raise money. It really was heartwarming to get that support from our mates without any hesitation. </p><p><span>Our team of 15 family and friends are going to run/walk 2500km in 31 days of March. This is the distance of a marathon every week EACH (41km)!!! We will be tracking all of our distance as a team on the Strava app and uploading our progress on a regular basis for you all to see how were getting on!

MK has decided to dedicate one night per week to making different cakes/desserts and selling these for charity (very proud mum moment). She has decided to donate this money to Macmillan throughout March, starting Saturday 27th February. As her mum, I will oversee this and ensure everything is done correctly. We are on the food register to trade from our home address and I have my level 2 food hygiene. I will provide her with enough packaging for the month, the ingredients for her 1st week and deliver everyone's orders with her. Ingredients for the remaining weeks will be taken from the money she makes and the rest will go directly to Macmillan. She will choose a few different items to sell each week and you can choose from these. There will be hot and cold options available each week and Vanilla ice cream as an optional extra. These will be made up on Saturday afternoons and delivered between 6 and 8pm on Saturday evenings. A post will be put up at the beginning of each week with 'whats on the menu' so you can get your order in before the Saturday.<br/></p>",MK's Makes for Macmillan,0,0,0,0,0,true,true,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MK's Makes for Macmillan ,https://www.justgiving.com/Danielle-Smithers1,/Danielle-Smithers1,United Kingdom,...MK's Makes for <strong>Macmillan</strong>...,MK's Makes for Macmillan,//images.justgiving.com/image/89770384-7a56-40e9-b850-bbb29f70b06c.png?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,11.529693,Danielle  Smithers,2021-02-19T07:11:32,2116,6531153,2021-04-04T00:00:00,0,13507,eafdd346-26e2-4266-95f8-d952e1445517,NA,NA,Macmillan Cancer Support,2116,261017,2116,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-02-20T07:05:08Z

I'm raising money for the British Heart Foundation because of the amazing work they do and I'd be so grateful for your support. The BHF has helped halve the number of people dying from heart and circulatory disease in the UK but sadly every day hundreds of people lose their lives. It's only thanks to the support from people like us that the BHF can create new treatments and discover new cures. £24 could pay for two hours of research by an early career scientist, but every pound helps so please give what you can to help me hit my target.

Also to raise money. :),true,True,False,true,Active,"<p>Hi everyone!<br/><br/>As you can see, I have decided to give up chocolate for the month of March. Because I am clearly a masochist, I have chosen to take on the toughest of the three available challenges and also give up sweets and fizzy drinks. </p><p>Many of you are probably aware that I don't and never have consumed fizzy drinks. I'm also not a huge sweet eater in the grand scheme of things. So, to make sure that this challenge is actually a -challenge-, I will personally be giving up chocolate (my favourite food), cake (I'm a keen baker and March is my birthday month), and ice cream (my other favourite food), including ice cream derivatives like milkshakes.</p><p>Why have I decided to torture myself so thoroughly? Well, because this is important. Despite them being the world's biggest killers, heart and circulatory diseases only get a fraction of the funding of other killers like cancer. This is not to say that research into these other illnesses doesn't deserve the funding they get, because of course they do. But it is to say that more can be done and needs to be done to help people with heart issues.</p><p>To make this a bit more fun, I'm planning to keep everybody regularly updated on my slow journey into sugar-deprived insanity via blog posts or Instagram posts or similar. I'm still working out that part, but I'll be sure to update everybody as and when I decide how I'll be keeping you all entertained. </p><p>For now, I invite you to read on and find out how the BHF has been coping with fundraising efforts during the pandemic. Thank you for taking the time to read what I have to say, and please do donate if you've got a couple of quid to spare.</p><p>All the best,<br/>Gillian<br/><span><br/>--</span></p><p>The pandemic is the biggest challenge we've faced in our 60 year history.

Its a warm and welcoming place where we give expert care to people with a terminal illness, and their loved ones, every day of the year. 

Our hospice team includes doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, social workers and many more, and is supported by over 200 volunteers  who play a vital role in the running of the hospice.

We have a 24-bed in-patient unit, where relatives and friends can visit any time of the day or night, and stay with their loved ones if they wish.

Our out-patient unit offers clinics, therapies and group sessions  and freshly cooked lunches made by our chefs. We also support carers and families, including children, with practical advice, counselling and bereavement support groups.

We need to raise £9,600 per day to run the hospice, so every penny counts. Thank you for helping to make sure more people with a terminal illness in Solihull get the care and support they need.
