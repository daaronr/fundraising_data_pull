I am completing the 75 Hard Challenge in memory of my beautiful friend Selina Carthy. The challenge includes eating a healthy diet, drinking a gallon of water a day, avoiding all alcohol and refined sugar and other junk food, reading at least 10 pages of non-fiction daily, and doing 2 separate stints of exercise each day, each one lasting at least 45 minutes and with at least one of the exercise challenges being outside.

Selina's husband Neil had requested that we do not send flowers but to send any donations to Cancer Research UK in her memory instead, and this is why I have chosen this cause. Thank you again for taking the time to look at this page and for considering this extremely worthy cause. </font></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span style=""background-color: transparent;""><font color=""#000000"">Sumi Janmohamed Rampling</font></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><font color=""#000000""><span>------</span></font></p><p dir=""ltr""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);background-color: transparent;"">Selina was that sassy, spirited, outspoken girl at school who stood for Labour in our school mini-elections and purposefully irritated the sea of Conservatives that made up our student body. I was that quiet, uncertain girl hiding behind a book. Selina saw beyond what most others dismissed, and so I have been her honoured friend since the age of 11.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);background-color: transparent;""> </span><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);background-color: transparent;"">Selina knew all the routes in and around London by both bus and by car, and she found my lack of direction-sense shocking. She had to advise me on which bus to take to get from my home in Ealing to her house in Perivale. The 297 from Castlebar Road and the 83 from Ealing Broaday are two bus routes that I will never forget, because Selina made sure of it. </span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);background-color: transparent;""> </span><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);background-color: transparent;"">Selina and I, along with a few other friends, would invariably spend New Year’s Eve together. In the early years, we would gate-crash Selina’s parents’ parties to hoard big plates of the chicken that her dad had so beautifully marinated, along with tubs of Häagen-Dazs for dessert. We would then set up in the conservatory to watch films back to back (Jean Claude Van Damme featured prominently, at Selina’s insistence). Fast forward a year or two, when we would take the train in to Central London to see what all the fuss was about, get the night bus home and THEN sit down in the conservatory to watch films (still featuring the Muscles from Brussels) and perhaps have a boogie to Bruce Springsteen.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);background-color: transparent;"">When we were at our respective universities, I remember speaking to Selina via payphone and wondering, “How much of our adventures will we be able to recount to each other before this 50p runs out…?” I remember visiting her in Leeds where she was in her element, drinking cocktails at Henry’s Bar and frequenting that terrible 1990s night club which seemed almost identical to the equally terrible night club that I frequented in Cardiff where I was studying. </span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);background-color: transparent;""> </span><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);background-color: transparent;"">The phone calls continued when I moved to Australia, and there I heard about Selina’s new adventures and parties… and this guy called Neil who managed to steal her heart in a flash.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span style=""background-color: transparent;""><font color=""#000000"">When I lived in the USA and Selina learnt that I was going through a stressful period, she sent me off to New York <span>City</span> where I got pampered with beautiful snacks, herbal teas and the best massage I've ever had. </font></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span style=""background-color: transparent;""><font color=""#000000""><span>Then, when I eventually returned to the UK, Selina took it upon herself to be my personal matchmaker. I must say she was terrible at it, but nobody was happier than she when I finally settled down with the right person. She even offered to host my Mehndi ceremony in her beautiful home, not </span><span>minding</span><span> that this would involve hundreds of my friends and family </span></font></span><font color=""#000000""><span>members traipsing in and out of it. Not wanting to take advantage of her generosity I declined, although I suspect that she was actually a little disappointed that I did! </span></font></p><p dir=""ltr""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);background-color: transparent;"">Selina and Shoma also planned my hen-do with no holds barred. They put the management of the Ritz in a complete tizzy when we turned up in our sashes, heart balloons and tiaras (ok, the tiara was just me) — quite frankly, they had never seen anything quite like this within their hallowed walls. </span><br/></p><p dir=""ltr""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);background-color: transparent;""> </span><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);background-color: transparent;"">Selina always remained a force in my life. She spurred me on when my confidence dipped and told me I was a mover and a shaker when I felt like I was at rock bottom. She celebrated good times with me, and pampered me when I was stressed or in need of some love by booking massages and facials. </span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);background-color: transparent;"">Selina is the most kind, giving, strong, spirited person that I have ever met. She did everything in her own unique way, she did it in style and she did nothing by halves. I am torn between absolute devastation that I must walk through the next stages of life without her and sheer gratitude that we walked through so many stages of our physical lives together. I will miss you, beautiful friend — have a peaceful ascent.</span></p>",Sumi's 75 Hard Challenge,67.50,0,280,35,0,https://images.justgiving.com/image/773c0afc-c795-44c4-bb6b-583b4228823d.jpg,https://images.justgiving.com/image/773c0afc-c795-44c4-bb6b-583b4228823d.jpg?template=size150x150face,NA,NA,NA,NA,true,NA,75 Hard,https://www.justgiving.com/Kulsum-Rampling,/Kulsum-Rampling,United Kingdom,,Sumi's 75 Hard Challenge,//images.justgiving.com/image/65a2e9ab-15dc-4165-9b92-c3b59ec94e5a.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,13.3555975,Kulsum Rampling,NA,NA,2020-10-25T09:24:12,2357,6300275,2020-10-25T09:24:12,800,13174,668b9dc8-6de4-4469-9caf-475fe58c887c,Cancer Research UK,2357,1089464,2357,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2020-10-26T06:12:10Z
