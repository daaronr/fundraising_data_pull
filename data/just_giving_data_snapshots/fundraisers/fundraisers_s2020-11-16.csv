You could complete 100 metres, 100 minutes, 100 days  be creative!

The sponsorship money you raise will make a difference. £100 could pay for five hours' training at a Guide Dogs training school.

It's thanks to people like you that we can continue to provide life-changing services, like our guide dogs, to people with sight loss. So, a huge thank you and lots of luck for your challenge!
