Both of my parents died due to heart complications before my seventeenth birthday. Luckily one of them was brought back. </p><p>At my Dads funeral we raised money for this charity and as it is coming up to the anniversary of his passing I decided to raise money for them again in order to try and ensure no one else needs to go through this as not everyone is so lucky to get a parent back.</p><p>So please help and give what you can and aid the lifesaving research of the BHP.

It is thanks to the research done by the BHF, funded by donations, that now 7 out 10 people survive heart attacks instead of 7 out of 10 heart attacks being fatal like it was 60 years ago. It is their research which gave us the break throughs to diagnosing and treating numerous heart and circulatory diseases. Charities have never needed us more.</p><p>Virtual fundraising challenges such as Dechox is a great way to help out as well as give yourself a sense of achievement by completing these challenges. The willpower of the person taking on the challenge mixed with the donations they gather is put into continuing the vital research done by the BHF so that they can make more breakthroughs. Despite everything, heart and circulatory diseases are still the world's biggest killers. </p><p>Please donate or even join me in Dechox in March, 2021.
