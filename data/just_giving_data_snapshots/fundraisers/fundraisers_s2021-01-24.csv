It's only thanks to support from people like us that the BHF can create new treatments and discover new cures. £24 could pay for two hours of research by an early career scientist, but every pound helps so please give what you can to help me hit my target.

If just everyone on my Facebook friends list donated £1 we could raise over £1200 for this amazing cause.

Many of us have lost parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, siblings, and friends. I am, quite frankly sick of hearing the words, ‘I’ve got cancer’. I’ve heard them recently from my friends, Jinx, Amie, Tina, Nicki, and my aunt Lynney. Lynney and Jinx are still fighting, but I’m delighted to say that my other friends are in good health. <br/><br/>My friend Rachael Sargeant was diagnosed with Breast Cancer in September. I cannot even begin to imagine what that must have felt like. Rachael and I were good friends at school, and she has a young son, Oliver. <br/><br/>The good news is that the prognosis is good, it’s been caught early and is treatable. She sought medical assistance as soon as she found a lump.<br/><br/>The ‘not so good news’ (in the words of her surgeon) is that the histology results show that her tumour, which they initially thought was non-invasive, did contain an invasive mass within it. This wasn’t expected. Fortunately, it hadn’t spread as was caught early. Further testing has been done to see what receptors it contained - as most breast cancers will grow from 3 of them, meaning hormone therapies can be used to stop reoccurrence. In a small % none of these are present so a diagnosis of ‘triple negative breast cancer’ is given and no hormone therapies etc can be used to prevent reoccurrence. <br/><br/>You’ve guessed it, that’s what hers is.<br/><br/>She needs Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy, and yearly mammograms until she is 50. She needs to shield for 12 weeks meaning that she has to be incredibly careful about who she mixes with, at a time when she needs all the support she can get.<br/><br/>Rachael has been through surgery, and is now going through Chemo, in the middle of a pandemic. <br/>Let that sink in for a moment. In the middle of a pandemic. Cancer is hard. Rachael has only just turned 40.<br/><br/>I can’t do much to help Rachael at the moment, but I can help raise money for the amazing charity that has so much amazing work and has got us to the point where Cancer IS treatable. I will therefore be running 56 miles during the month of February for your hard-earned cash! <br/><br/>If you can spare just a few pounds I would be so grateful.<br/><br/>Together we will beat cancer.<br/><br/>Facebook pays all the processing fees for you, so 100% of your donation goes directly to the non-profit.Thanks for taking the time to visit my JustGiving page.</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

The hospice is a warm, welcoming place where loved ones can be together in peaceful surroundings and in as much comfort as possible. Whether it's for one day or several weeks, the time people spend at the hospice is precious, and is cherished by them and their families.

Thank you for supporting us, and helping to make sure more people with a terminal illness in North London get the care and support they need.

I chose the panda because they are endangered and the logo for the WWF and I chose the walrus because they are endangered too and after watching David Attenborough's 'Our Planet', I knew that they needed our help, just like lots of other species like the snow leopard and the mountain gorilla and sadly, increasingly more but we can do something about it if we change our ways.</p><p><span>The reason why I am raising money for the WWF is because of David Attenborough as he has inspired me to do something about climate change.

Just £30 could provide a full kit to protect a health-worker on the frontline, including gloves, masks and coveralls, while just £43 could help provide 1,680 pairs of disposable gloves for health workers.
The impact of a large-scale outbreak of coronavirus on children, especially poor and vulnerable children, has been immense. Children are at risk from the disease, but also from the disruption to health and education services, impacts on caregivers, and separation from family members.
Unicef has been working closely with governments and the World Health Organization (WHO) since the start of the coronavirus outbreak.
