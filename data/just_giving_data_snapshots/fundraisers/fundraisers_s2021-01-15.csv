She quietly, efficiently and professionally accessed all the resources it was possible to access, adjusting medication until Bill was largely pain free with minimum side-effects, anticipating needs, listening attentively to his wishes and compassionately to his fears, responding to rapid changes in his condition, advocating with other professionals on his behalf (where needed with the patience of a saint!) thus accessing scans and appropriate treatments and most critically, working with a level of love and care that was truly outstanding.

It often progresses to AML, which is a form of leukaemia. There is no cure for MDS. An allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) is the only potential cure or attempt, to slow it down for patients with MDS.</span> </p><p class=""p1"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><span class=""s1"">My Gramp had his own business which he loved working every day, he loved seeing everyone’s faces and having a chat and a giggle. As well as Coming home to my Nan, and winding her up constantly! His personality and voice is what he’s most known and loved for by many. People would say they could hear him before they see him</span><span class=""s2"">&#128516;</span><span class=""s1""><span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span>he loved his cars , especially his new Range..and our crazy family so much. He had the biggest heart and the best stories. </span></p><p class=""p1"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><span class=""s1"">He would always tell me how proud of me he was, even if he would then follow off the statement with a sarcastic comment to wind me up. We had the best banter, constantly making fun of each other until one of us would give up! There are many of us, children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Who each he had a special bond with, taught life lessons and made us laugh</span><span class=""s2"">❤️</span></p><p class=""p1"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><span class=""s1""><span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span>However, The cancer slowly but surely ripped all of that away from him. Over the course of a year, he would visit the hospital multiple times a week for scheduled blood transfusions to help him stay as strong as he possibly could. He stayed in hospital multiple times as the year went on. The majority of 2020, he spent in the hospital, which as you can imagine was horrible due to covid we couldn’t visit him anymore.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></span></p><p class=""p1"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><span class=""s1"">He lost his mobility and independence. This was the hardest thing for him to accept, as his mobility and independence was what enabled him to work, drive, socialise and just be him. He had to gain the strength to pretty much learn how to walk again as he had been so unwell for so long, he was too weak to walk and always in pain. This was when it really started to hit home that we’re loosing him.</span></p><p class=""p1"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><span class=""s1"">The final time he went into hospital was the worst. ‘End of life’ care had begun. We put all things in place for him to be able to come home for the remainder of the time we had with him. District nurses and Marie Curie cancer nurses would visit multiple times a day to do their checks and care for him. I stayed at the house and worked from home during the day, then would stay awake all night to make sure he wasn’t in any pain or discomfort. Then to call out the nurses if he needed more pain relief etc.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></span></p><p class=""p1"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><span class=""s1"">As the days went by he deteriorated extremely fast.H</span><span>e was home for a week fighting his absolute best to stay with us.

Almost one year on, we still have not had opportunity to celebrate her life or give her the send off she truly deserves - as Covid restrictions literally hit as we laid her to rest of 31st March 2020. On the 24th March 2021; Lou would be celebrating her 40th birthday. This is why we want to ‘March for Lou’ and would ask anyone that wants to get involved join us too &#128155; Whether you want to raise money for this or any other charity, we would love for you to join us in honouring her memory throughout the month of March. You do not need to take part every day, do as much as you can, when you can. This will be a huge challenge for me personally; (mentally & physically) there are days when I struggle to even walk around the block. Our beautiful Lou spent her last weeks under the care of Marie Curie and in thanks to them in allowing us to spend precious time with her; I am hoping to raise funds to allow them to continue in helping families tragic times. Daffodils lined the streets and roads the month Lou passed, even more so it seemed March 2020..... I can’t help but think this was her way of letting us know she was ok & showing us that her bright, vibrant energy will be with us always. &#127804;&#128155;&#127804;",March for Lou,13.75,0,55,6,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,bc92eed5-86d8-4ec8-a113-1b5e88bb0ca7,march-for-lou,6563efa9-9b60-4ee9-aee3-1cf1a58d8ed8,NA,NA,NA,Step into Spring 2021,https://www.justgiving.com/march-for-lou,/march-for-lou,uk,,March for Lou,//images.justgiving.com/image/76de9a88-b9af-475b-9790-2082754a08ac.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,9.292018,Alison Fox,400000,Steps,2021-01-14T19:17:42,50,6371521,2021-03-01T00:00:00,1000,12130,0bc2ce02-949a-423d-83ca-69db32dcbc68,Marie Curie,50,207994,50,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-01-15T07:03:49Z
