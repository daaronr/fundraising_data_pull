I'm raising money for the British Heart Foundation and I'd be so grateful for your support, in 2002 Rory was born with a  congenital heart disease, Tetralogy of Fallots, it was a bolt from the blue and literally turned our lives upside down. Even at the turn of this century without pioneering surgery a child with this diagnosis would rarely have made it to its first birthday.</p><p>Thanks to British Heart Foundation and ongoing development of their research Rory has had surgery and is still closely monitored, the repairs that are carried out are not lifelong. Rory had an appointment at paediatric cardiology this week and depending on MRI results will now be discharged into the care of adult cardiology, this is a HUGE milestone and without ongoing research just wouldn’t have happened.</p><p><span>I want to give something back so wonder if people will donate to support me running another 100 miles from today before the end of this year meaning I will have run a total of 1006 miles this year.
