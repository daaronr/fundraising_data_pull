At the same time when I can be having the best days of my life, somebody else is already aware that the very same days are their last ones, aware that they are not able to spend them as safely, peacefully, and with dignity, as they would wish. That can be changed and we all can help, offer the piece of being taken care of to terminally ill patients in this difficult moment. And that is something which shouldn't really have a price, but in reality, does. A big one.

Sponsor me to help WWF protect our one shared home. Climate change poses the biggest threat to the future of our planet. The Earth's atmosphere is warming, faster than it probably ever has. This causes negative impacts such as the melting of Arctic sea-ice, prolonged heat-waves and rising sea-levels. It may seem a bit chilly for some of us, but the Arctic is crucial for lots of reasons. Its home to around four million people, including indigenous communities, and there's an amazing amount of wildlife too, all uniquely adapted to life in this icy landscape. Polar bears, penguins and walrus call this freezing landscape their home. But their environment is changing, because of global warming. The sea ice during the summer months is declining, and with global warming, that ice is shrinking fast.
