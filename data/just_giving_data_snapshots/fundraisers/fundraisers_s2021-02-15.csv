The impact of a large-scale outbreak of coronavirus on children, especially poor and vulnerable children, has been immense. Children are at risk from the disease, but also from the disruption to health and education services, impacts on caregivers, and separation from family members.
Unicef has been working closely with governments and the World Health Organization (WHO) since the start of the coronavirus outbreak.

2021 is a vital year in the global campaign to make our world one without malaria. This coming June, the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and the vitally important Kigali Summit on malaria and neglected tropical diseases will take place in Rwanda. The summit marks a historic moment that will unite global leaders and put a spotlight on the importance of renewed action in fighting malaria. We need more action, more innovation, more funding and more political leadership to defeat malaria and move forward stronger in this new global health landscape.

Across Rentokil Initial, colleagues are taking part in a 9,000km Race to Kigali (the distance between our HQ and Kigali, Rwanda), including teams from America, Australia, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Caribbean, Africa, HR, IT, Finance, M&A and Legal. By combining the efforts of colleagues walking, running or cycling, each team will ‘reach’ the distance to Kigali.  This is our global effort to raise funds and show our support for this vital cause.  It all starts on Monday 15 February through to the UN’s World Malaria Day on 25 April.

Andy Ransom: ""As a proud patron of Malaria No More UK, I am asking my colleagues at Rentokil Initial, as well as friends, family and associates to get involved in the Race to Kigali. In doing so, helping raise incredibly important funding for Malaria No More UK at such a critical time. Rentokil Initial Cares, our charitable fund, will match every £1 raised up to £100,000.”  

Together we can achieve a Zero Malaria world within a generation.

2021 is a vital year in the global campaign to make our world one without malaria. This coming June, the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and the vitally important Kigali Summit on malaria and neglected tropical diseases will take place in Rwanda. The summit marks a historic moment that will unite global leaders and put a spotlight on the importance of renewed action in fighting malaria. We need more action, more innovation, more funding and more political leadership to defeat malaria and move forward stronger in this new global health landscape.

Across Rentokil Initial, colleagues are taking part in a 9,000km Race to Kigali (the distance between our HQ and Kigali, Rwanda), including teams from America, Australia, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Caribbean, Africa, HR, IT, Finance, M&A and Legal. By combining the efforts of colleagues walking, running or cycling, each team will ‘reach’ the distance to Kigali.  This is our global effort to raise funds and show our support for this vital cause.  It all starts on Monday 15 February through to the UN’s World Malaria Day on 25 April.

Andy Ransom: ""As a proud patron of Malaria No More UK, I am asking my colleagues at Rentokil Initial, as well as friends, family and associates to get involved in the Race to Kigali. In doing so, helping raise incredibly important funding for Malaria No More UK at such a critical time. Rentokil Initial Cares, our charitable fund, will match every £1 raised up to £100,000.”  

Together we can achieve a Zero Malaria world within a generation.

CARE is focused on helping the most vulnerable people, through distributing food to families in need, and cash vouchers so that families can purchase for themselves the food they need.

Over a year of fighting and fuel shortages has destroyed water pipes and water pumping facilities, so CARE is rehabilitating water sources and providing water tanks so women and children can get safe drinking water without having to travel long distances.

CARE is also providing hygiene kits, paying special attention to womens and children's needs.
