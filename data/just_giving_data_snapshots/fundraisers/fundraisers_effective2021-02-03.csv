With your support, Oxfam can continue its life-saving work, it can continue to put together packages of food, give farming support, set up foodbanks, support education for women and girls, and provide cash to buy essentials.

For each £15 we raise, we could help more women to understand their rights, challenge discrimination and to take up leadership roles within their local communities.

For each £35, we could help families access emergency food supplies. 

£45 could provide one of our new handwashing stations to enable frequent handwashing and disease prevention.

With your support, communities can come together to help each other.

A new type of music festival that is part of Oxfams rich musical history.

Oxjam started 2006 with the aim of creating a network of music-loving people across the UK, all united by a shared goal  to raise money to fight poverty and suffering around the world.

Its a community festival run by volunteers and made up of multi-venue festivals and gigs taking place across the UK throughout October. Its all about supporting independent music venues and providing a platform for up and coming musical talent while raising money to fight poverty and inequality worldwide. Now thats something we can all get behind.

More than 2 million people could be affected by the disaster, which has forced thousands from their homes. The death toll has reached over 1300 people. 

And, as rescuers work around the clock to find survivors in the rubble, its expected to rise even further. Due to the scale of the destruction, we urgently need your help to get clean water, food and shelter to survivors in the worst hit areas.

Were aiming to reach 500,000 people in Palu city and Donggala district with life-saving supplies  but we cant do it without you.

Just £30 could provide a full kit to protect a health-worker on the frontline, including gloves, masks and coveralls, while just £43 could help provide 1,680 pairs of disposable gloves for health workers.
The impact of a large-scale outbreak of coronavirus on children, especially poor and vulnerable children, has been immense. Children are at risk from the disease, but also from the disruption to health and education services, impacts on caregivers, and separation from family members.
Unicef has been working closely with governments and the World Health Organization (WHO) since the start of the coronavirus outbreak. Donations made to my page will help to limit the spread of the virus and reduce the impact on children and families.

Liz championed many children's charities during her lifetime, both in the UK and internationally. She sought to improve and transform the lives of disadvantaged children, through charities that focussed on introducing children to both the Arts and classical music, and supporting those that gave children access to inspirational activities. Liz highlighted the needs of children and teenagers who through life circumstances become carers, and tried to make their lives easier. She chose the NSPCC and UNICEF, for any donations made in her memory, possibly for a current disaster fund. As both charities are currently working very hard to support children specifically affected by the Coronavirus pandemic, we know that Liz would want to help them in achieving that aim.</span></p> <p></p>",UNICEF donation in memory of Dr Elizabeth Sears,195,0,830,830,0,NA,NA,Recognising Liz's life-long affinity with children because of her chosen career focus with young  people,Recognising Liz's life-long affinity with children,of her chosen career focus with young  people,NA,Elizabeth Sears,786596,Elizabeth Sears,/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/13002503,remember/786596,df9c41f3-684c-4125-9d70-dfad35931a19,ElizabethSears,NA,NA,NA,NA,In memory of Elizabeth Sears,https://www.justgiving.com/Elizabeth-SearsUNICEF,/Elizabeth-SearsUNICEF,United Kingdom,...<strong>UNICEF</strong> donation in memory of Dr Elizabeth Sears...,UNICEF donation in memory of Dr Elizabeth Sears,//images.justgiving.com/image/90b81edd-592a-4505-b782-308cd1063a24.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,28.541193,"Sears NSPCC First team,  UNICEF Second team",2020-05-18T13:56:25,181813,6001287,2020-05-18T13:56:25,100,183895,0cabef16-0288-4ed6-a2b4-0b9895c71dd7,Recognising Liz's life-long affinity with children,of her chosen career focus with young  people,Unicef UK,181813,2021-02-03T08:22:08Z

This relates to a week experiencing the types of distances millions of children are still walking daily to reach water. If participants want an additional challenge they can carry water or an equivalent weight to that which children are carrying (5kg, 10kg or 15kg). Get sponsored to take part, aim for a target of £1,500 per team of ten (£150 per individual).

The money raised from this challenge will go towards UNICEF's Children's Emergency Fund. Which provides crucial support for children in emergencies  wherever and whenever conflict or disaster strikes.

Millions of childrens lives are at risk today because of emergencies caused by conflict, natural disasters and climate change. They could be sudden, or may have been going on for a long time. You wont see many of them on the news, but every day these emergencies threaten the lives and futures of countless children.

Millions of childrens lives are at risk today because of emergencies caused by conflict, natural disasters and climate change. They could be sudden, or may have been going on for a long time. You wont see many of them on the news, but every day these emergencies threaten the lives and futures of countless children.

Thank you so much for your support!

Unicef fears that children are among the casualties.

Already battling against coronavirus and economic instability, the disaster in Beirut adds to the crisis for the people of Lebanon. The pandemic has left hospitals overwhelmed and frontline workers exhausted.

Unicef is on the ground working closely with authorities and partners in Lebanon to respond to the needs of children, families and health workers.

Unicef are providing safe drinking water and hygiene kits for children and families in the city. They're helping set up counselling to support children who are experiencing trauma and those who have lost loved ones.

The mental health of children has also been threatened, as it is incredibly challenging to stay at home and keep up with virtual learning without the proper resources to do so. And these are just some aspects of a broader dynamic that can't be narrowed down to a few lines. For this reason<span style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);""> I will share some</span><span style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);float: none;""> links at the bottom of the page, please do inform yourself on what is going on.</span></p><p><b>So what? </b>To put it simply, this means that more children need more help now, <i>our</i> help. </p><p>Under lockdown, while studying and working in front of a screen, I often found my mind lingering on the following dilemma: &#34;<i>What can I do to overcome the current limitations and significantly help those affected children</i>?&#34;. If before the pandemic <span>I could easily volunteer and pioneer for children's rights in a variety of ways as I have often done, the current restrictions have made it way more challenging to reach out to those in need. Thus I realised that I would have had to make the best out </span>of the only<span> two </span>tools<span> still available to </span>fundraise,<span>  which are internet and about one hour of outdoor exercise per day</span> (aka <span style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);float: none;"">my daily spark of joy) </span><span>to <span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);float: none;"">contribute to an initiative that will be life changing for many children</span>. </span></p><p>This is how I decided to run<span> the 2021 Royal Parks Half Marathon and</span><span> fundraise for Unicef.

This relates to a week experiencing the types of distances millions of children are still walking daily to reach water. If participants want an additional challenge they can carry water or an equivalent weight to that which children are carrying (5kg, 10kg or 15kg). Get sponsored to take part, aim for a target of £1,500 per team of ten (£150 per individual).

The money raised from this challenge will go towards UNICEF's Children's Emergency Fund. Which provides crucial support for children in emergencies  wherever and whenever conflict or disaster strikes.

Millions of childrens lives are at risk today because of emergencies caused by conflict, natural disasters and climate change. They could be sudden, or may have been going on for a long time. You wont see many of them on the news, but every day these emergencies threaten the lives and futures of countless children.

She is going to run 2.6 miles with daddy locally and making sure she follows social distancing. Evie is aiming to raise £100 pounds on top of daddy's target!!<br /><br />I am incredibly honoured and privileged to be given the opportunity to run the London Marathon 2020 in aid of UNICEF. I chose this charity because of the incredible work they do with children, and as a teacher I know the importance of giving children the opportunities to be able to thrive. <br /><br />Unicef was created in 1946 to help protect children after World War 2, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child is the basis of all of their exceptional work. Today they continue to help children get vaccinated, educated and influence laws and policies to help protect children all around the world.<br />Right now, children in places like Myanmar, South Sudan and Yemen are caught up in violent conflict. They are fleeing war and disaster in greater numbers than at any time since World War 2. And in countries such as Nepal and the Philippines, children have seen their communities destroyed by natural disasters like earthquakes, typhoons and flooding.<br /><br />In a humanitarian emergency, Unicef responds rapidly and stay as long as they are needed 💪🙌👍.  <br /><br />Having run only 2 marathons before; the experts tell me I need to give myself around a 24 week training schedule. So now I'm on a mission running numerous paths, found various places I never knew existed and realised that nothing is more fun than running in the heavy wind and rain 😅. <br /><br />Reading the London Marathon website, it states “Ethiopian legend Kenenisa Bekele is set to take on Sir Mo Farah and Eliud Kipchoge in a stunning Virgin Money London Marathon elite men’s field”, disappointingly there is no mention of myself, its like they feel I don’t have a chance 😂.<br /><br />Any way here’s to, pasta, blisters and chaffing and please do donate as much as you can to such a worthwhile cause 👍🙌💪.<br /><br />Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure. Your details are safe with JustGiving - they'll never sell them on or send unwanted emails. Once you donate, they'll send your money directly to the charity. So it's the most efficient way to donate - saving time and cutting costs for the charity.",Maz's Run - London Marathon 2020 and 2021,166.62,0,1800,90,0,https://images.justgiving.com/image/f7bc7698-fb6a-4d25-9453-2f70c85068ee.jpg,https://images.justgiving.com/image/f7bc7698-fb6a-4d25-9453-2f70c85068ee.jpg?template=size150x150face,I am running the London Marathon in aid of UNICEF because all children deserve a brighter future,I am running the London Marathon in aid of UNICEF,all children deserve a brighter future,LJYV66,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,London Marathon 2021,https://www.justgiving.com/Maz2020,/Maz2020,United Kingdom,,Maz's Run - London Marathon 2020 and 2021,//images.justgiving.com/image/98cc4b9d-85f1-4597-897c-9a83cbe7150d.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,10.26433,Iain Mazonowicz,2019-08-30T20:02:35,181813,5246239,2021-10-03T00:00:00,2000,183895,6d447b71-a8bb-4f26-9bd2-a9cc899637b3,I am running the London Marathon in aid of UNICEF,all children deserve a brighter future,Unicef UK,181813,2021-02-03T08:22:08Z

Just £30 could provide a full kit to protect a health-worker on the frontline, including gloves, masks and coveralls, while just £43 could help provide 1,680 pairs of disposable gloves for health workers.
The impact of a large-scale outbreak of coronavirus on children, especially poor and vulnerable children, has been immense. Children are at risk from the disease, but also from the disruption to health and education services, impacts on caregivers, and separation from family members.
Unicef has been working closely with governments and the World Health Organization (WHO) since the start of the coronavirus outbreak. Donations made to my page will help to limit the spread of the virus and reduce the impact on children and families.

In many of the other countries where they work, MSF teams are working with local health authorities to prepare for the impact of COVID-19. Even during this crisis, MSF are determined to keep their regular medical programmes running for the tens of thousands of patients they support. 


I'm raising funds to help support MSF's medical teams on the ground to respond to the coronavirus crisis. Your donation can make a big difference:


- £16 can pay for a surgical tunic, trousers and a pair of sterile reusable gloves.

- £28 can pay for protective plastic goggles for four doctors.

- £58 can pay for sterile gloves for 30 medics.

- £110 can pay for five protective suits to keep staff safe.

After five years of war, more than 80 percent of the population, 24 million people, need humanitarian assistance.

MSFs activities in Yemen are among their most extensive worldwide, but the needs remain huge while the healthcare system is even weaker than it was in 2015, when conflict erupted.

MSF is running the only COVID-19 treatment centre for the whole of southern Yemen. Their teams are working around the clock to provide the best level of care that they can.

How your support makes an impact

£10 could provide eight dressings for wounds 
£17 could provide two leg splints to treat fractures 
£31 could pay for 40 oxygen masks 
£97 could pay for a physiotherapist for one day

MSF's medical teams are also gearing up to confront potential outbreaks in the hundreds of areas they were already working before the pandemic struck. MSF are deploying medics, sending supplies and applying nearly 50 years of experience fighting epidemics to protect the most vulnerable and save lives.

How you can help:

- £16 can pay for a surgical tunic, trousers and a pair of sterile reusable gloves.

- £28 can pay for protective plastic goggles for four doctors.

- £58 can pay for sterile gloves for 30 medics.

- £110 can pay for five protective suits to keep staff safe.

After five years of war, more than 80 percent of the population, 24 million people, need humanitarian assistance.

MSFs activities in Yemen are among their most extensive worldwide, but the needs remain huge while the healthcare system is even weaker than it was in 2015, when conflict erupted.

MSF is running the only COVID-19 treatment centre for the whole of southern Yemen. Their teams are working around the clock to provide the best level of care that they can.

How your support makes an impact

£10 could provide eight dressings for wounds 
£17 could provide two leg splints to treat fractures 
£31 could pay for 40 oxygen masks 
£97 could pay for a physiotherapist for one day

After five years of war, more than 80 percent of the population, 24 million people, need humanitarian assistance.

MSFs activities in Yemen are among their most extensive worldwide, but the needs remain huge while the healthcare system is even weaker than it was in 2015, when conflict erupted.

MSF is running the only COVID-19 treatment centre for the whole of southern Yemen. Their teams are working around the clock to provide the best level of care that they can.

£10 could provide eight dressings for wounds 
£17 could provide two leg splints to treat fractures 
£31 could pay for 40 oxygen masks 
£97 could pay for a physiotherapist for one day

After five years of war, more than 80 percent of the population, 24 million people, need humanitarian assistance.

MSFs activities in Yemen are among their most extensive worldwide, but the needs remain huge while the healthcare system is even weaker than it was in 2015, when conflict erupted.

MSF is running the only COVID-19 treatment centre for the whole of southern Yemen. Their teams are working around the clock to provide the best level of care that they can.

How your support makes an impact

£10 could provide eight dressings for wounds 
£17 could provide two leg splints to treat fractures 
£31 could pay for 40 oxygen masks 
£97 could pay for a physiotherapist for one day

We are attempting this challenge for various different personal reasons, one mainly being that we would like to raise money for MSF and Action against hunger charities respectively, during this especially difficult time. </p><p>I have tweaked the trending programme personally and for 75 days I aim to;</p><p>*Exercise twice a day for 45 mins (one has to be outdoors come rain or shine). *Drink up to a gallon of water per day (this can include electrolytes). *Read 10+ minutes of a self help or entrepreneurs book/s per day. *Stick to a (predominantly plant based) diet - no unhealthy snacks or refined sugars, and no alcohol or smoking. *Take a progress photo every five days. If I fail any of the aforementioned I must start again from day one. This is no easy feat!</p><p>I have already urinated outdoors several times! On some days after a day of doing a HIIT class &amp; a long bike ride I wake up aching all over (especially with my being hypermobile) and don't feel like exercising at all, so I do light things like hula hooping and swimming. Some days I have missed out on cake! I think myself so blessed to be able to do this. I am focusing more and more on nutrition and really want to hone the diet over the next few weeks. I cannot express enough how grateful I am.</p><p>Right now, MSF is providing urgently needed medical care and support in more than 70 countries to counter the coronavirus disease.  MSF's medical teams are also gearing up to confront potential outbreaks in the hundreds of areas they were already working before the pandemic struck. MSF are deploying medics, sending supplies and applying nearly 50 years of experience fighting epidemics to protect the most vulnerable and save lives worldwide.</p><p>Upon completion of this challenge if I achieve to raise the target amount I will upload my start and finish photos (in my underwear)! I am aware times are tough for people during this pandemic and if you cannot spare a couple of quid that's no worries at all - if you can hit the share button that would mean so much to me.

Right now, MSF is providing urgently needed medical care and support in more than 20 countries to counter the coronavirus disease. In Europe, MSF is supporting health authorities in Italy, Spain, France, Belgium and Switzerland. 

MSF's medical teams are also gearing up to confront potential outbreaks in the hundreds of areas they were already working before the pandemic struck.

- £28 can pay for protective plastic goggles for four doctors.

- £58 can pay for sterile gloves for 30 medics.

After five years of war, more than 80 percent of the population, 24 million people, need humanitarian assistance.

MSFs activities in Yemen are among their most extensive worldwide, but the needs remain huge while the healthcare system is even weaker than it was in 2015, when conflict erupted.

MSF is running the only COVID-19 treatment centre for the whole of southern Yemen. Their teams are working around the clock to provide the best level of care that they can.

£10 could provide eight dressings for wounds 
£17 could provide two leg splints to treat fractures 
£31 could pay for 40 oxygen masks 
£97 could pay for a physiotherapist for one day

I’m not even sure why I did. I think I probably saw the stats on the likelihood to get a place, (about 1 in 25 ballot entries got a place) and I figured there was no harm.....or chance.</p><p><span>When my ultra-marathon-running husband, John, (who literally runs marathons for fun!) got his “sorry, not this time” letter from Virgin, I offered a sympathetic shoulder pat and carried on with my day, blissfully forgetting my own entry. So when I received my “You’re in!” letter the following week, 2 words immediately popped into my head. The first was “oh”, and I’ll let you decide the second......(it was definitely “crikey” Mom &amp; Dad if you’re reading this).</span></p><p><span>Knowing the extremely slim chance of getting in, I found it very difficult to think of a good enough and genuine reason to decline the place despite my total inexperience in long distance running. I’d just completed the Wolverhampton half marathon which was my greatest physical achievement thus far (after giving birth....obvs....) and if you’d told me I was only half way through the course after those 13.1 miles, I’d have thrown in the towel. It was SO tough and I know this will literally be the hardest thing I’ve ever done. But both physically and mentally I’m up for the challenge. 26.2 miles. Wowser....</span></p><p><span>So, if I’m doing this, I want to do some good. Pay it forward. I’ve chosen to fundraise for WaterAid because I believe clean, safe water should be available to every single person on this planet. How often do you taken water for granted? Leave the tap running too long, boil more than you need, not finish a glass of water and throw it away? I’m certainly guilty of all of the above but so many people don’t have the luxury of clean water and it costs lives and creates squalid living conditions. So anything I can do to help bring water to those without is a good thing.</span></p><p><span>Please please please support in any way you can. I am so grateful for any support, whether it’s a donation (obvs), offering to accompany me on a training run (you have no idea how grateful I am to those who have offered!) or standing on the sidelines offering me Jaffa cakes and fruit pastilles in London on 26th April.....I’ll be forever grateful. </span></p><p><span>Let’s do this.

Lebanon was already facing a triple crisis; with an economic and food crisis and the most recent COVID-19 health crisis. Beirut also has the third highest population of Syrian refugees in the country (hosting over 200,000 people) who are already some of the most vulnerable and stand to also be some of the worst affected by this latest tragedy.

Families are in urgent need of shelter, food, and emergency supplies. CARE is on the ground in Lebanon and our teams are rapidly assessing the needs and preparing to respond with lifesaving support to help families recover from this disaster.

CARE currently works in 79 poor and developing countries, helping millions of the world’s poorest people find routes out of poverty. They are there to provide life-saving assistance when disaster strikes, and to help people rebuild their lives afterwards and they are there to work alongside poor people and communities on long-term programmes to deliver lasting change.</p><p>Their programmes and  policy work tackle the underlying<br/>causes of poverty so that people can become self-sufficient. They place special focus on empowering women and girls because, equipped with the proper resources, women have the power to lift whole families and communities out of poverty. CARE is non-religious and non-political, allowing them to deliver humanitarian and development assistance to anyone in need regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, age, religion, political view or sexual orientation.</p><p>Thanks for your support with my London Marathon JustGiving challenge!My page donations will be sent direct to the charity in a fast and secure way.

Lebanon was already facing a triple crisis; with an economic and food crisis and the most recent COVID-19 health crisis. Beirut also has the third highest population of Syrian refugees in the country (hosting over 200,000 people) who are already some of the most vulnerable and stand to also be some of the worst affected by this latest tragedy.

Families are in urgent need of shelter, food, and emergency supplies. CARE is on the ground in Lebanon and our teams are rapidly assessing the needs and preparing to respond with lifesaving support to help families recover from this disaster.

Together we can help respond with lifesaving support for people affected by the disaster.

Every 10 minutes, a child dies from malnutrition or disease. They need help and I want to try to change the lives of some children, to give them a future.<br/>I hope to raise a significant amount of money. I'm starting with an ambition of raising £150. <br/>I want to raise people's awareness of Yemen's condition, and how people are suffering there, to encourage them to support my project.<br/>I'll come up with creative ideas to raise money for the charity. <br/>I hope my project will inspire others to raise money to support the people of Yemen as well.<br/>I expect this project to take up a great deal of my time over the coming months. <br/>Initial fundraising ideas are: dog walking, weeding, designing things to sell and being sponsored to do things.

Yemen is suffering from one of the world's worst humanitarian crisis. It hurts to think we have stores and stores full of food in the UK and so much wastage, where a mere fraction would be so useful to supporting the other side of the world. It is so sad to think that 85,000 </span>children<span> under 5 have died from starvation!</span></p><p><span>We know how devastating Covid-19 has been on our day to day lives and just think, how Yemen would have felt, when they already had the pressure of war and famine to deal with. </span><span><br/></span></p><p><span>I have made this page in hope of raising funds to </span>contribute<span> towards Yemen's famine crisis. If any of you have little nephews, nieces, sons and daughters, please empathise with the many mothers who are scared of losing their children. Please donate what you can - whether it be £3, £5 or £10 and so on towards a cause you know are serving the helpless. I would appreciate it! </span></p><p>I will be donating £40 to CARE and in addition will be meeting targets of my own. I have recently got back into running after a chronic injury and want to get better timings running around my local park and will be reporting these times. I also have always been interested and protective of society's minorities that are disadvantaged - whether that be mental health, physical disability and people with impairments. The minority I want to focus on are deaf people and how sign language is not commonly known nor taught. Due to this lack of accommodation and preventable communication barrier, many deaf people must feel side-lined by society. Therefore,  I will be learning 20 sign language phrases (British Sign Language), in addition to the alphabet, and will be posting these learnings on social media (FB and instagram). My aim is to focus on these targets, of improved running times and BSL learning, for 30 days. </p><p>Here's a little more about CARE...</p><p><span> CARE is focused on helping the most vulnerable people, through distributing food to families in need, and cash vouchers so that families can purchase for themselves the food they need.
