This will coincide almost exactly with my leaving date from NHS Digital (sob!). I can't promise (and don't expect) to run 5k, but I do promise to travel it on foot every day, come rain, shine, hell, highwater and whatever media craziness comes my way. It's my leaving gift to myself. These last few months have been tough and taking care of myself has come way down the list, so I am forcing myself to get some balance before I start my new challenge as Director of Comms at Sherwood Hospitals Trust.

Early in the year, the doctors ran out of treatment options and in April he collapsed suddenly. Since then he’s been at home and Andrew and I have been  looking after him along with a fantastic team of carers. We’ve had many  uplifting conversations with him during this time about how much he  enjoyed his childhood, friendships, his time in the army, his career and retirement.</p><p>The ending was as peaceful as we could possibly have hoped for. Andrew and I were both with him, holding his hands, in his own home just as he wanted. The help we’ve had this last week from the carers, St.  Christopher’s Hospice, Marie Curie and the district nurses has been  truly amazing, giving him a dignified, peaceful and painless end that we were worried he wouldn’t have. We've chosen Marie Curie as Dad was already a benefactor of St. Christopher's.<br/></p><p>Over the last few months, Andrew &amp; I have been reflecting on what an outstanding father he has been – the perfect Dad. He adored his seven grandchildren and was immensely proud of them all. His devotion and care for our mother, who has advanced dementia, in recent years is a model of marriage that will remain with us.</p>",A Celebration of the Life of David Blacknell,0,50,0,0,0,https://images.justgiving.com/image/c602a293-a314-40ea-a4ff-562c3e7a436e.jpg,https://images.justgiving.com/image/c602a293-a314-40ea-a4ff-562c3e7a436e.jpg?template=size150x150face,NA,NA,NA,814189,David Blacknell,/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/13411999,remember/814189,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,In memory of David Blacknell,https://www.justgiving.com/davidblacknell,/davidblacknell,United Kingdom,,A Celebration of the Life of David Blacknell,//images.justgiving.com/image/801eb787-ad0f-4018-a6a8-eda7fe4640db.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,21.16537,Paul Blacknell,2020-10-14T12:32:28,50,6278615,2020-10-14T12:32:28,0,12130,92b4d777-dc61-4ddb-bbbe-ec51d8faa862,NA,NA,Marie Curie,50,207994,50,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2020-10-15T05:13:29Z
