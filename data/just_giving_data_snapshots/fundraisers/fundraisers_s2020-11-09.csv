This news came as a total shock to him and the whole family and coming to terms with the reality has, and continues to be an emotional rollercoaster for everybody but most of all my Dad who continues to puts on a brave face each and every day. </span><br/></p><p>Shortly after his diagnosis, my Dad started chemotherapy to try to shrink the numerous cancers and give him more time. Throughout the past few months my Dad has gone through numerous rounds of chemotherapy and health complications due to the side effects. He has gone through all this in the midst of a global pandemic which meant he has attended his consultant appointments alone, chemo alone, he has shielded in the same 4 walls for months, he has missed out on precious time with family and friends and making memories due to lockdown and the restrictions. Even with all this he still has fight in his heart and shows pure determination. He continues to fight so hard mentally and physically every day to not let the big 'C' beat him. He's a true hero and I couldn't be prouder.</p><p>He has now completed his chemotherapy and the results have been as positive as they can be. He has been given extra time that without the chemotherapy, he would not have. He will continue to undergo specialist treatment to try and suppress the cancer as much as possible which, although there is no guarantee on the affectiveness of the treatment, it can potentially give my Dad more time to live his life to the fullest. I am so very thankful for this, I get to make memories with my Dad and cherish every day with him. (Well, once lockdown is over) . <span>Its true, you don't realise who and what you take for granted until life turns things upside down and you are faced with a heartbreaking reality. </span></p><p>I would give anything for a miraculous cure for my Dad. We as a family will continue to be positive and hopeful that he will remain in as good health as possible for as long as possible. Thanks to Macmillan, we have been able to get a better understanding of my Dads condition and ways to help and support him and us. Macmillan provide vital resources from recipes for food to eat during chemo, to user friendly information sheets on treatments, medication, side effects, advice, support and so much more.<span> Each time my Dad went to his Chemo he was made to feel at ease by the amazing NHS staff and macmillan nurses who treated him. There is so much more Macmillan do that I'm sure over time we as a family will make use of and without fundraising and donations this wouldn't be possible.</span></p><p><span>So, in order to encourage my Dad to get active and also raise</span><span> awareness and funds for Macmillan at the same time, We have made a pact that each day starting from the 9th of November 2020, for 40 days that myself, my Mum and my Dad will do some form of fitness/excersize each day. I will be aiming to complete a range of workouts and runs to push myself each day. My Mums aim is to get more active, go on walks and prioritise time for excersize each day. My Dads aim is to do non exhursive exersize on his good days and keep as active as possible each day (On my Dads bad days I will do double, lets hope there's not to many of these). </span><span>By doing this I hope it gives my Dad a focus each day and help his, my Mums and my mental and physical health. </span></p><p><span>If you wish to donate to this extremely worthwhile and needed charity through our go fund me page, we would be very greatful! </span></p><p><span>Hold your loved ones just that little bit tighter and appreciate every second, because you never know whats round the corner ❤</span></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Thanks for supporting my fundraising.

I have decided to partake in this 24 hour gaming marathon in aid of Macmillan. Cancer is something that has affected a lot of people very near and dear to me throughout my life and in memory of them I’m hoping to raise as much money as I can to help this charity. As you probably guessed I will be playing mostly warzone but I will also be doing challenges and playing other games for donations. Infact I will literally do anything gaming related for the right donations, so if you’re in need of a warzone win I’m all yours for the right price lol. 
Please, please help me in helping this charity as much as I possibly can.
Thanks, il see you in verdansk.

So that’s why I’m going to stream for an entire month and hopefully reach my fundraising goal even if we don’t make the Goal just something will help. I’ll be live on twitch Monday to Friday for an entire month streaming entertaining and doing forfeits hopefully as the donations come in and we reach the goal and maybe even surpass the goal would be amazing.</p>,WE GOT THIS,0,0,0,0,0,true,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,53922849-6e69-4322-addb-a2b7a21e32e5,NA,NA,NA,NA,Game Heroes 2020,https://www.justgiving.com/pretty-sick-gaming,/pretty-sick-gaming,,,WE GOT THIS,//images.justgiving.com/image/3567ba43-93d3-4a73-a24d-133e87d23b46.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,6.875983,James Taylor,2020-11-08T13:19:54,2116,5821741,2020-12-31T00:00:00,250,13507,f7868ee9-e5c0-447b-97fa-bdf2a1a74922,NA,NA,Macmillan Cancer Support,2116,261017,2116,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2020-11-09T06:16:31Z

I'm running and fundraising because vulnerable children need us to step up our efforts,Hi Folks! I'm running and fundraising,NA,true,True,False,true,Active,"<p>Dear reader,</p><p>The global pandemic has been disrupting our modes of life for months now, and once again the most innocent among us have been severely affected: I am talking about children. <span>I do not mean to sound overly dramatic - I will leave that rhetoric to some crybaby politicians, and stick to my </span>straightforward communication style instead...<span> So, let's face reality: because of this virus, children around the world have been affected in multiple ways. </span></p><p><span>In a direct way, the virus could result in loss of parental care due to death, illness or separation, thereby placing children at heightened risk for violence, neglect or exploitation. <span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51);text-align: left;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);float: none;"">More indirectly,<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> m</span></span></span><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"">any of the prevention and control measures have resulted in disruptions to the reporting and referral mechanisms of child protection services.</span> For children in residential care, a lack of capacity and resources has resulted in a rapid closure of such facilities, with children being returned to families without proper preparation. For children in street situations, access to help and support services is likely to be even more challenging. Moreover, measures to contain the virus have affected delivery of vital support and treatment services as well as contact with informal support networks. And these are just some aspects of a broader dynamic that can't be narrowed down to a few lines. For this reason<span style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);""> I will share some</span><span style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);float: none;""> links at the bottom of the page, please do inform yourself on what is going on.</span></p><p><b>So what? </b>To put it simply, this means that more children need more help now, <i>our</i> help. </p><p>Under lockdown, while studying and working in front of a screen, I often found my mind lingering on the following dilemma: &#34;<i>What can I do to overcome the current limitations and significantly help those affected children</i>?&#34;. If before the pandemic <span>I could easily volunteer and pioneer for children's rights in a variety of ways as I have often done, the current restrictions have made it way more challenging to reach out to those in need. Thus I realised that I would have had to make the best out </span>of the only<span> two </span>tools<span> still available to </span>fundraise,<span>  which are internet and about one hour of outdoor exercise per day</span> (aka <span style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);float: none;"">my daily spark of joy) </span><span>to <span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);float: none;"">contribute to an initiative that will be life changing for many children</span>. </span></p><p>This is how I decided to run<span> the 2021 Royal Parks Half Marathon and</span><span> fundraise for Unicef. Unicef needs our help to support children around the world. Your donation will help to provide children life-saving food, vaccinations, education and protection.  Help me smash their fundraising targets and help children worldwide! </span></p><p><span>Your donation </span><i>will </i><span>make a difference, just as every single vote in the latest American presidential election has lead to a great </span>milestone<span> for democracy and gender equality.
