This year the service will be going on-line to allow our community to still take part and to celebrate the work of their local lifeboat and its crew.</p><p>The Walk in the Sea  has been a very popular and well-supported Boxing Day event for 18 years, when 400 or more brave souls rush into the sea at 11am, clad in a wide variety of costumes, most of them rushing out again even faster a minute or two later .  The event enjoys very wide publicity, with over 2,000 spectators gathering on the promenade. Bucket collections and registration donations raise in excess of £8,000 each year but sadly the event has had to be cancelled.</p><p>The Teignmouth Lifeboat stations income, already severely depleted, will lose two of its biggest sources of income, but we hope that those of you that would normally take part in these events or support them will consider making a donation to support the lifesaving work of the Teignmouth Lifeboat and its volunteer crew by donating via this Just Giving Page.</p><p>Thank you for your support and Happy Christmas from all of us at Teignmouth RNLI.</p>",Teignmouth Lifeboat Xmas Events,0,0,0,0,0,true,true,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,f23f97e1-ff2e-4cb0-ab56-093b1e85f355,NA,Carol Concert & Walk in the Sea,https://www.justgiving.com/TeignmouthLifeboatXmasEvents2020,/TeignmouthLifeboatXmasEvents2020,United Kingdom,...Teignmouth <strong>Lifeboat</strong> Xmas Events...,Teignmouth Lifeboat Xmas Events,//images.justgiving.com/image/e48c9a52-9606-48e0-ad45-4fe21d00bf88.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,49.295963,Teignmouth Fundraising Team,NA,NA,2020-12-03T22:30:30,11200,6390287,2020-12-03T22:30:30,5000,13270,a5993d3c-dc82-405f-97e6-d3b3c6f12d43,RNLI - Royal National Lifeboat Institution,11200,209603,11200,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2020-12-04T06:16:46Z
