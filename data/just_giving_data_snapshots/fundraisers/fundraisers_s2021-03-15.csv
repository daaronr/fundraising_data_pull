He was cared for by Marie Curie in his final months and Kirsty said, the hospice gave us our dad back.

When dad was first diagnosed, I felt like my insides had been ripped out, it was a real gut-wrenching moment. He was a single parent and brought us up on his own, so we were all really close. Dad was a really active, sociable man and never viewed himself as an elderly person. When Marie Curie was first mentioned dad wasn't keen and I must admit I also thought that's where you go to die. But he was there for about four weeks and I can honestly say Marie Curie gave us our dad back. That was just the best thing ever - he had no distress and we knew they were taking such good care of him.
The nurses said they would let me know when they felt dad was close to the end so I could stay with him and I ended up self-isolating with him at the hospice for the last week of his life. That meant the world to me.

We were inseparable. We loved how we were identical.</i></p><p><span><i>I was petrified of these things which were apparently called balls. Ban-Ban was<br/>frightened of rain, especially when it was heavy. The farmer, whose name was<br/>Ethan, knew about our fears. We played for hours until suddenly, it started<br/>raining heavily. Oh wow- it felt like a monsoon. Wait! Where’s Ban-Ban? I ran<br/>after him eagerly, but soon, I felt like I was running in circles. </i></span></p><p><i><span><span> </span></span><u><span>Ban-Ban</span></u></i></p><p><span><i>I started running as fast as my little paws would take me. I<br/>could hear the concerned yells of my mother and father but I ignored them. The<br/>rain was now heavier and I could barely see. I stumbled forwards, finally<br/>seeing a glint of gold, which I dared hope was sunshine. It was! Faint, but<br/>still! However, the golden glint was wheat. I ran forward happily but suddenly the<br/>interminable plant covered me and I couldn’t see. </i></span></p><p><u><span><i>Bol-Bol</i></span></u></p><p><span><i>How could Ban-Ban run off like this? It wasn’t raining anymore. I<br/>looked around frantically, scanning the farm for a small, black-and-white bundle<br/>of fur. I panicked. Ethan spotted me! However, he thought I was Ban-Ban.</i></span></p><p><span><i>“Ban-Ban!” Oh no! Just as I predicted, he rolled a ball over to<br/>me. I screamed, which seemed like a squeak to Ethan. Ethan was confused. I<br/>squeaked angrily, and Ethan started laughing. This was no joke! Ethan disappeared<br/>to look for the real Ban-Ban.</i></span></p><p><u><span><i>Ban-Ban</i></span></u></p><p><span><i>I fought the wheat until I managed to escape. I saw Bol-Bol<br/>staring after a distant figure which I guessed was Ethan. I ran to Bol-Bol and<br/>grinned. He turned away but I could already see that he had been crying. Then,<br/>I saw a ball. I was about to go over and comfort him but just then Ethan saw<br/>us, gave me a wave and started to run. Bol-Bol gave a frightened squeak! Now I<br/>understood! Ethan had mixed us up! </i></span></p><p><u><span><i>Bol-Bol</i></span></u></p><p><span><i>“Ban-Baaaaan,” I screamed, making it go in slow motion. </i></span></p><p><span><i>“Bol-Bol!” he grinned. We squealed delightedly. Then, he gave me<br/>a panda hug. Ethan had come.</i></span></p><p><i><span>“Who’s Bol-Bol and who’s Ban-Ban?” muttered Ethan. “Aha! You’re<br/>Bol-Bol.” He pointed at me. “And you’re Ban-Ban.” He pointed at Ban-Ban. After<br/>that, Ethan played with us. When Ethan went, I turned to my twin and started<br/>chattering with him about the greatest adventure ever.

I strained to<br/>listen and heard ‘How can you blame them, Raksheey, they’re only little’ and<br/>some chuckles from my father as a reply.
