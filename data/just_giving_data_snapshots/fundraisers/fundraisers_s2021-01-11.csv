She loved family, friends and her little bungalow garden, where she looked forward to the spring flowers every year, promising the end of winter. The only shadow in her life was the death of her<span> beloved husband Alf, who died </span><span>of cancer 40 years ago.

In the 1980s she became </span><span>one of the first Pilgrims Hospice volunteers  and worked tirelessly </span><span>for the organisation for over 20 years both at the Margate Hospice and in the Cliftonville shop. She </span><span>was also a strong supporter of the Macmillan nurses who had provided such comfort </span><span>and support to her when she was nursing dad alone at home in his final months.

The BHF has helped halve the number of people dying from heart and circulatory disease in the UK but sadly every day hundreds of people lose their lives. It's only thanks to support from people like us that the BHF can create new treatments and discover new cures. £24 could pay for two hours of research by an early career scientist, but every pound helps so please give what you can to help me hit my target.
