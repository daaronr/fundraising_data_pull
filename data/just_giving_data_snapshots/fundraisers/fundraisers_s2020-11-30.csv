I’m starting this fundraiser as a way to give back to MacMillan for all the help and support they provided for my Aunty Maggie. 

Maggie was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer a few years ago, she put up an amazing fight, she not only defeated the odds given to her but champed through her battle up until the very end. Unfortunately Maggie passed away on the 27th of november. 

This is my way of saying thank you to macmillan and hopefully we can raise some money towards an amazing cause. 

Times are hard right now, so any donation at any amount will be massively appreciated.</p>",Chlowdin,8.75,0,60,40,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,53922849-6e69-4322-addb-a2b7a21e32e5,NA,Game Heroes 2020,https://www.justgiving.com/chlowdin,/chlowdin,,,Chlowdin,//images.justgiving.com/image/e6cb99f2-97c5-43f0-94c5-ac9586ca6fe8.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,6.9069643,Chloe Bowdin,NA,NA,2020-11-29T11:47:42,2116,5821741,2020-12-31T00:00:00,150,13507,b8127a3d-d30f-4e40-82a4-b543e97e37a4,Macmillan Cancer Support,2116,261017,2116,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2020-11-30T06:14:49Z

After five years of war, more than 80 percent of the population, 24 million people, need humanitarian assistance.

MSFs activities in Yemen are among their most extensive worldwide, but the needs remain huge while the healthcare system is even weaker than it was in 2015, when conflict erupted.

MSF is running the only COVID-19 treatment centre for the whole of southern Yemen. Their teams are working around the clock to provide the best level of care that they can.

How your support makes an impact

£10 could provide eight dressings for wounds 
£17 could provide two leg splints to treat fractures 
£31 could pay for 40 oxygen masks 
£97 could pay for a physiotherapist for one day 

Thank you so much.
