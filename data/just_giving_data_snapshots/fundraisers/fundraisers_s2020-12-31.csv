To mark this occasion, I’m challenging myself to run 54 miles in February to raise money for MacMillan Cancer care, a charity very close to our hearts. Those who know me will know I am absolutely NOT a runner so although this may not be a challenge for some, it’s a massive challenge for me! For those of you who don’t know our story</span></p><p class=""p1"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><span class=""s1"">My Dad was a fit and healthy man, he didnt smoke and played rugby on a weekly basis. In December of 2010 he suddenly became poorly. He went to the doctors who told him he had a chest infection, and later he was told he had pneumonia. He went into hospital for this but was soon released, however he didn't get much better. He went back to the hospital, and on the 31st of January he was diagnosed with lung cancer. We were heartbroken but knew we needed to make the most of the time we had with him. Unfortunately, we didn't have much time at all, and he passed away on the 2nd of February, only a few days later. Nurses had never seen a case like this before. The time between the diagnosis and his passing was extremely short. I said goodbye to my Dad at the age of only 12, one week before my 13th birthday. It was the worst experience of my life, but fortunately, a Macmillan nurse named Clare helped us immensely. I am so greatful for Clare and the work she did for our family, so I felt I wanted to raise money for the charity in order to give something back to the wonderful team Macmillan have, and also to pay my respects and remember my Dad, who I love and miss more and more everyday. I miss my Dad massively and would do anything I could to get him back, however I know that is impossible and so the closest I can do to that is raise money for Macmillan so they are able to help and support another family like mine, and hopefully make their situation a little easier.</span></p><p class=""p1"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><span class=""s1"">I would really appreciate it if you could take the time to sponsor me.

Thomas has a rare birth defect, but thanks to the specialists at GOSH, he has received the surgery needed and is doing well. GOSH really is the centre of excellence for treating children with rare and/or complex health conditions. It was so reassuring when Thomas was referred to GOSH to meet the consultant who had extensive experience of the defect - we are very lucky to have the NHS and the level of expertise and specialisms of those who work within it. Thomas and I have had several trips to the hospital and have witnessed first hand the genuine kindness of the staff and the amazing set up of the hospital. It really is the little things that make the difference, such as each room/bay having a TV that can access YouTube and cbeebies (being able to play stickman was a god send in distracting Thomas when having his obs), to the play specialists (solely funded by the charity) and the range of toys they were able to use to engage with Thomas when he was upset because his stitches were hurting or he was hungery due to fasting prior to CT/MRI or surgery. The NHS funds the running costs of the hospital but it's the charity that funds the vital elements such as research, ensuring access to latest technologies and specialist areas such as the activity rooms. Therefore this January, I'm kickstarting 2021 by taking part in Running off Christmas. I'll be running 31 miles throughout the month to raise money for GOSH.
