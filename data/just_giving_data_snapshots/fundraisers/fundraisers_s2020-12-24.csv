My sister was diagnosed with breast cancer back in September at the age of 25, and has been going through chemotherapy during the pandemic with my family effectively isolating since September. During her treatment she has been supported by Macmillan, who have provided crucial information for her, as well as providing a network to support her if the need ever arose . My sister has shown incredible resilience, and I cannot begin to describe my pride for her, for this reason I want to support those who can actively support my sister, as well as other cancer sufferers.<br/>I realise over the pandemic that many organised events, such as marathons and other fundraising events have not been able to go ahead, which makes supporting groups such as Macmillan more crucial than ever. </p><p><br/>My fundraiser challenge is to run 250km in January, which is:<br/>•    5.9 full marathons<br/>•    42.4 laps of Silverstone circuit<br/>•    Further than London to Cardiff (242.6 Km)<br/></p><p><span>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and secure.

My grandfather died of colorectal cancer in his late 70s when I was too small to grasp the absolute certainty of death. He was blessed to have been able to be in his own home with 2 of his children.  Looking back now I think how the excellent palliative services we have now would have made it so much easier for him in his final weeks. 
McMillan cancer nurses are a lifeline for the patient and family and an invaluable source of support for health professionals  for providing the best care for  cancer patients.
We often associate McMillan cancer support with palliative care but they do so much more such as providing information and supporting patients through their diagnosis and treatment, being their advocate and providing valuable financial advice.
The NHS is under immense pressure because of the pandemic. Cancer care has also been hugely impacted and McMillan plays a valuable role in helping to take off some of this pressure.

I hope by this small fundraising venture to show how accessible running is for everyone. You don’t have to “look” or “feel” like a runner to be one..I certainly don’t. You just have to love it and want to keep doing it. Honestly if I can do this pretty much anyone can. As a recent couch to 5k graduate I am still really slow and this will definitely be a challenge but its not necessarily about being fast and running more miles but just enjoying the process. As a busy working mum with 2 kids it has been an invaluable source of stress relief.
It's funny how my love for running started with a fundraiser and I remember running for the sake of the fundraising rather than for the sake of the run and yes, how I once hated it.
Charities such as McMillan have suffered a huge blow to their finances as so many of their regular fundraising events have been cancelled due to the pandemic. Like so many of us I am caught in the treadmill of work and looking after family and so little time to do anything else besides such as volunteering or fundraising. This is just a small attempt to come off that treadmill for a little while and hoping to help make a small difference for the better in the lives of others.&nbsp;</p>",Shyma's 10 day 5k challenge ,0,0,0,0,0,true,true,NA,NA,NA,93e8ac1b-9514-4cbc-aa9b-96a47fbd3382,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10 Day 5K Challenge,https://www.justgiving.com/shymas-10-day-5-k-challenge,/shymas-10-day-5-k-challenge,United Kingdom,,Shyma's 10 day 5k challenge ,//images.justgiving.com/image/a0b8019c-c7b4-4bf6-ad8c-b34208bbe0bc.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,15.82736,Fathima Fazal,NA,NA,2020-12-23T21:46:52,2116,5989360,2020-12-31T00:00:00,150,13507,a3f8c0c2-dd2d-463f-804d-9f479ace21de,Macmillan Cancer Support,2116,261017,2116,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2020-12-24T06:15:05Z
