Me and my son (7)will be doing a 24 hour gaming livestream together. To raise money towards cancer support.
We lost a very dear lady to cancer 7 years ago. She was my fiance and she is his mum. She was only 27 years old and was taken from us all way before her time.He never got to know the type of woman she was, he struggles every single day with the loss of his mum.
It is my goal to raise awareness for other familys going through these same struggles, to help other young children in his situation to get the help they need at the right time.

Daniel was first diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia when he was 8 months of corrected age, he’d been born prematurely and battled through this, spending 4 months at home before staying in Great Ormond Street children’s hospital for 5 and a half months undergoing 4 round of chemotherapy. In 2017, Daniel relapsed with 2 different types of cancer his original AML and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, something which GOSH had never seen as a relapse - usually this presents first line and typically very difficult to treat. Daniel endured 7 weeks of painful chemotherapy, and died due to complications of parainfluenza, normally something that is a minor illness in children with a good  immune system. Daniel died 9 days later after spending this time on a ventilator, he was strong and amazing throughout, but unfortunately his body could no longer continue. </p><p> Despite Daniel’s ill health, his little spirit and joy always shone, he was a joy to be around and he was our sunshine, he made us grow and be happy, </p><p> Sometimes people ask how do I carry on? Some days, I don’t know, but I know I have to continue to carry on Daniel’s legacy, and by running and raising funds for this amazing charity really does help me to carry on. </p><p> Daniel’s memorial fund raises money for family accommodation,  which we really benefited from being housed close to Daniel when he was on the paediatric Intensive care unit (PICU), the fund also raises money for the play workers who do such amazing work, we benefited from the help of Jen who Daniel loved, as did we, and also to raise money for hard to treat leukaemia’s that are kinder and tailor made for children. </p><p> I appreciate that I am always running, never running the best times, but I keep going because of Daniel and I really appreciate all of your support in helping me to honour Daniel’s memory, and to fundraise for an amazing charity.</p><p> Thank you all in advance, I really appreciate it x</p>",ali's page,7.50,0,30,2,0,true,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,827096,Daniel  Farbrace,/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/13635921,remember/827096,NA,London 2 Brighton Challenge 2021,https://www.justgiving.com/ali-farbrace3,/ali-farbrace3,United Kingdom,,ali's page,//images.justgiving.com/image/2b28de89-a65a-4645-80f3-4120e06efd70.png?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,11.963862,ali farbrace,2020-12-28T21:19:00,254,5918602,2021-05-29T00:00:00,0,12057,8e69c862-bfdc-44d6-a35d-c8dafd86db24,NA,NA,Great Ormond Street Hospital,254,1160024,254,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2020-12-29T06:19:23Z

I’m doing it again but this year things are a bit different. On the 9th of September 2020  I found out that I had breast cancer. To say that it came as a bit of a shock is a gargantuan understatement. I’m a fit, healthy, non-smoker so was lulled into a false sense of security that I was at minimal risk. However, my diagnosis, which identified the type of cancer and effective treatment pathway, was made possible as a result of years and years of dedicated research. I am very lucky. A series of good clinical decisions (referral, biopsies -all of them) detected my cancer early  and allowed me the option of the least invasive surgery to remove it, before it had spread and eliminating the need for follow up chemotherapy. My treatment is ongoing but I am thrilled to be back running and have set myself the target of the 7th of February to run 10k. </p><p>Cancer Research UK is facing a massive hole in funding this year and, whilst I know that 2020 has been ‘challenging’ (feel free to insert your own adjective here) for everyone, their work has undoubtedly saved my life and will continue to improve outcomes for cancer patients.

Equating to a total distance of 300km ran each. Thats the same distance as running from Swansea to London, to put it in perspective. <br/><br/>Whilst we are doing this venture, we want to raise some money for 3 charities that are close to our hearts - MIND, Cancer Research and The National Blood Clot Alliance.<br/><br/>Mind is a charity that supports individuals who are experiencing mental health issues. They campaign to improve services, raise awareness and promote understanding. Both of us have suffered from our own mental health problems around depression and anxiety. Given the uncertain times we find ourselves in and mental health being a more prominent issue than ever before, we want to play our part to help this amazing charity. <br/><br/>As for Cancer Research, it speaks for itself really. 1 in every 2 people in the UK will be diagnosed with Cancer at some point in their lifetime. Personally (Chris), I lost a Grandfather at a young age to Lung Cancer. I will never get to have the experiences with my Grandfather that every young man growing up would want. I (Ben) have also lost one of my best mates and had family members be affected by this terrible illness. Cancer Research does amazing work everyday to identify causes and develop strategies for prevention, diagnosis, treatment and ultimately find a cure. Contributing to this charity would mean a lot on a personal level both of us. <br/><br/>The finally charity is The National Blood Clot Alliance (NBCA). The NBCA is a non-profit, voluntary health organization dedicated to advancing the prevention, early diagnosis and successful treatment of life-threatening blood clots. I will be running for this charity due to the impact it has had one of my best mates Sam. Sam is currently studying out in America where he has had to undergo 2 surgeries to remove blood clots. When speaking to Sam he has explain how much this charity has helped him and recommend this charity in order to raising awareness and a donation for them.<br/><br/>At the end of the 60days, your donations will be split evenly in 3 ways with total raised going to each respective charity.<br/><br/>We would both like to thank you for your support and donations in advance, however small or large. <br/><br/>To help get the word out, please feel free to  share the link to our page on your socials on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter etc!<br/><br/>Thanks Again!</p>",Ben's 5K A DAY FOR 66 DAYS,28.75,0,190,38,0,true,NA,NA,aa5487b4-39e5-4cf3-9164-79a5f5afb544,BenChris5k66Days,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5K A DAY FOR 66 DAYS,https://www.justgiving.com/Ben-Chris0122,/Ben-Chris0122,United Kingdom,,Ben's 5K A DAY FOR 66 DAYS,//images.justgiving.com/image/trainer-no-branding_web.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true&sourcepath=Stock,Fundraiser,13.30821,Ben Watkins,2020-12-28T15:21:46,2357,6426943,2021-01-01T00:00:00,500,13174,383a75a4-3d34-42e6-a303-a5e592887279,NA,NA,Cancer Research UK,2357,1089464,2357,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2020-12-29T06:19:23Z
