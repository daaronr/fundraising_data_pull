All was going well in his recovery until he suffered complications almost 2 weeks post-op. Dad endured so much and put up such a fight whilst in hospital for nearly 2 months. Dad was rushed into hospital from home and it was confirmed he had sepsis of the blood, pneumonia and was later diagnosed as having had a stroke due to an infection called 'Endocarditis' which is fatal for people with prosthetic heart valves and dad had just had one fitted less than two weeks prior to this infection coming to light.  This infection took its toll and rooted itself in my dads newly engineered heart, to which it then spread throughout all of his organs. He underwent a 14.5 hour operation which had a 50/50 chance of being successful. Initially it was, his heart had been reconstructed due to a large proportion of it being infected and another two valves being replaced. It would have been more simple to give dad a heart transplant at this point but time wasn't on our side and this 'Commando Procedure' had to take place otherwise the infection would have taken his life. A few days later after this massive heart op, my dad suffered from a bleed on the brain and again it was touch and go as to whether he would survive another major operation after he had had 4 open heart surgeries in a month including a reconstruction. Dad was rushed from the Liverpool Heart and Chest hospital to a specialist Neurological hospital where he had brain surgery to stop the bleed. This was successful, however, my dad suffered a level of brain damage that left him unable to swallow. For the next two weeks dad was being tube fed and more often than not 'asleep' and on a ventilator. After this time the infections and damage that had been done to my dads incredible body was inevitably too much although he was relatively stable. My dads organs began to collapse and fail on the thursday and we said goodbye on the saturday.</p><p>The last two months have been a rollercoaster to say that least, but we are taking comfort in knowing he put up such a fight but the odds were against him. He wanted to come home to us so badly, but this wasn't possible. It's a bitter pill to swallow to think dad went into hospital for what was meant to be a 'life enhancing' procedures, but in the end it took his life.</p><p>Please donate as much or as little as you'd like to increase the research and experiments into heart diseases across the UK, so as little people have to go through this agony as possible.</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to visit my JustGiving page.</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.
