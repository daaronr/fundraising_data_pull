Whilst it initially sounds traumatic.. he actually didn’t realise it was quite so serious at the time and mistakenly thought it was just a touch of indigestion. So, he thought the best course of action would be to sit down on the sofa and pour himself a large glass of whiskey! 😂🙈 When he started to experience shooting pains down his left arm he thankfully called an ambulance, was taken to the hospital, operated on immediately and was fine! <br />Sadly, last year Dad had another heart attack. This time he recognised the symptoms straight away and called an ambulance. However, somewhere along the way, the message that he was having a heart attack got lost in translation and wasn’t passed on to the right teams. He had to wait over an hour for an ambulance to arrive, by which point, he had called the nearest person to him and they had managed to bundle him into the car and went flying off down the country lanes of Wales. No sooner were they out of Dad’s road when the ambulance wails around the corner, whizzing past in the opposite direction! They managed to turn the car around, stop the ambulance and eventually rush Dad to the hospital. Upon arrival, he went straight into surgery and again- THANKFULLY, was operated on and after a difficult stay in intensive care, we are incredibly fortunate that he recovered. <br />The incredible medical technology that the British Heart Foundation funds the research and development of, saved my Dad’s life not once, but twice. <br />A kind, supportive, incredibly loving Dad, he guides my heart in so much of my life and what I do, I owe a debt of gratitude to every single person that has helped to keep him by my side. ❤️",Alice's Fundraising Page,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,true,NA,NA,NA,482ae02d-c33e-467f-8285-8490e798b479,NA,My Step Challenge,https://www.justgiving.com/alices-fundraising-page383,/alices-fundraising-page383,,,Alice's Fundraising Page,//images.justgiving.com/image/9f068b5f-bc9c-4387-a859-e5087e927001.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,13.958813,Alice Strachan,500000,Steps,2020-11-26T23:08:52,183092,6346189,2020-11-14T00:00:00,100,641389,e88a0217-1379-40b8-9b73-fd6e0c360755,British Heart Foundation,183092,225971,183092,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2020-11-27T06:17:33Z

You could complete 100 metres, 100 minutes, 100 days  be creative!

The sponsorship money you raise will make a difference. £100 could pay for five hours' training at a Guide Dogs training school.

Great Ormond Street Hospital is<br/>a truly magical place – a place where, despite the fear and challenges that the children, families and staff face every day, they never forget how to smile, have fun and support each other. </p><p>The GOSH Charity supports the activities of the hospital in<br/>four ways:</p><ol><li>Rebuilding and refurbishment to ensure that<br/>children, parents and employees have the best possible conditions<span>  </span>to help them face what lies ahead.</li><li>Support for families and children – helping them<br/>to cope with their situation, share their journey with others and giving them a<br/>safe space to talk about how they are feeling. </li><li>Research into health – new breakthroughs are<br/>happening all the time, and by contributing to research, GOSH can ensure that<br/>their patients have the best possible care.</li><li>Life-saving medical equipment – the staff at<br/>GOSH are heroes, but they need a little help!

I lost my Grandad to cancer earlier this year, and due to COVID I was unable to even say goodbye to him. </p><p>I started running in January when he fell ill, as a coping mechanism I guess you could say. He was an avid runner himself in his day, running a few marathons, and enough half marathons to lose count. He was the best man I will ever know, and if I'm able to raise something that can go towards beating cancer and saving someone else's Grandad then it's worth it. </p><p>I've done a couple half marathons over lockdown, but that's the furthest I've ran, well aware a marathon is double the distance and a bigger kettle of fish to tackle. </p><p>I'm doing this marathon come rain or shine, on new years day, because let's face it, we can't exactly party this NYE. I thought it would be nice to start the year with my best foot forward (pun intended) and to end of a year of running (amateur-ishly) with the pinnacle of running, a marathon. Whether I run, walk or crawl I shall try my best to get the job done. </p><p>Thank you again. </p><p>BIG love, Danny x</p>",DANIEL's 26.2188 miles ,56.50,0,226,11,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,26.2188 miles ,https://www.justgiving.com/DANNY-ROSE26miles,/DANNY-ROSE26miles,United Kingdom,,DANIEL's 26.2188 miles ,//images.justgiving.com/image/trainer-no-branding_web.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true&sourcepath=Stock,Fundraiser,5.810108,DANIEL ROSE,I'm trying to do my bit,most of us have lost someone we love to cancer.,2020-11-26T12:26:52,2357,6373322,2021-01-01T00:00:00,2000,13174,26fb936c-0d8e-417b-ad44-ebaa7fc091d0,Cancer Research UK,2357,1089464,2357,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2020-11-27T06:17:33Z

More than ever we need the RNLI’s help. As a charity, the RNLI depends on our donations so it can go on saving lives and keeping us and our loved ones safe. RNLI lifesavers are our lifeline.
