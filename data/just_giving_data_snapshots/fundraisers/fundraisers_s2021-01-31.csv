During his time in hospital at the heart and lung hospital in London back in Jan 2016 was that there are a whole array of lung diseases and unfortunately they said there was nothing that they could do for him as too much water had entered his lungs - there was nothing I could do to shield him from that news and Drs had given us a timer on his life. I wish things were done differently and I wish he was treated as high priority because a life is a life.</p><p>Anyone who’s lost their loved ones due to this pandemic my heart goes out to you! This Pandemic has opened my eyes on a whole new level! I pray that we’re all protected from this vicious disease!</p><p>I know deep down my Daddy wouldn’t have survived COVID if he caught it! I wish I had done more for him and known more about these awful diseases! He was a fighter and he went on until the very end he walked until his body could no longer walk! He was my rock and always tried to keep me in my best health because of what he went through! I want to make him proud!</p><p>I will be giving up chocolate for a whole month! Even he knew how much of a chocoholic I was and my close family and friends know how much I’m obsessed with anything chocolate! Moving forward- I can do this for him, myself and my children! Please donate generously! Remember that ‘Charity does not decrease your wealth’</p><p>Thank you for taking time in reading this, I appreciate every one of you!</p><p><br/></p><p>Much love Zoy xox</p>",My Dechox Fundraising Page,0,0,0,0,0,true,true,NA,NA,NA,836761,Zulfiqar Ali,/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/13741341,remember/836761,f0b38c95-8e29-421c-81e0-4a7b00151c83,NA,NA,NA,Dechox 2021,https://www.justgiving.com/Zoyiaali,/Zoyiaali,United Kingdom,,My Dechox Fundraising Page,//images.justgiving.com/image/dc780b50-34fb-4169-af98-d5b2a9b39d70.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,9.976051,Zoyia Ali,NA,NA,2021-01-31T01:34:32,183092,6288571,2021-03-01T00:00:00,100,641389,f15c85ea-436f-4aac-96aa-76686ba5fae1,British Heart Foundation,183092,225971,183092,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-01-31T07:02:17Z

A decade has passed since I did my first collection back when I was at university! That's quite unbelievable when I think back on 10 years and all I've done in that time. Ordinarily, at this time of year I'd be getting ready to sign up to take part in Great Daffodil Appeal collections.</p><p>However, as with most things at the moment, these aren't going ahead in the usual way, but I still wanted to raise funds for Great Daffodil this year, and to also mark 10 years since I started helping this amazing charity out, so I have decided to host a little Virtual Quiz night to mark the occasion!</p><p>It'll be on Friday, 12th March 2021 at 7pm on Google Meets, and I am hoping to raise £200. All are welcome for the price of a donation of however much you can give to take part, whether on your own or with your family/support bubble. There will also be a prize for the winner of the quiz as well, of a £20 online gift voucher! <br/></p><p>I'm really excited to be doing this and I hope you'll all come along and join me for what promises to be an enjoyable evening that'll help raise much needed funds at what is still a crucial time for Marie Curie.<br/></p><p>Marie Curie provides care and support for people living with any terminal illness across the UK.

This bungalow meant everything to Grandpa and the whole family have great memories from the holidays we had there.
