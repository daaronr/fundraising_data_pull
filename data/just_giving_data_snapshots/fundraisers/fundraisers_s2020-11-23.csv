Just before me and my older sister billie called called upstairs into my bedroom and my mum sat us both on my bed she put her arm around both of us and started getting teary at the point me and billie didn’t know why then we found out why. She told us they my grandad had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. This was devastating but it didn’t make my head drop because I knew my grandad was so strong and I always told myself that. Whenever I met my grandad I didn’t treat him any different because of a disease. Once he had started doing chemotherapy after 2 weeks my grandad was rushed into hospital and this got me becoming really emotional just because I didn’t know what was going to happen and if I would see him. As six months passed and my grandad still in hospital my grandad had to get open heart surgery due to a closing valve connecting to his heart. Soon enough my grandad was allowed back home he would always tell me story’s that he had gained whilst in hopsital and the people around him and what they were like and how they kept him up at night this is because I didn’t see him much whilst in hospital but the odd time I would go on a Friday evening after school my mum would take me and billie and we sat in the hospital room and played dominoes his favourite game and he would always beat me. Now at home I was able to go see him a lot more and I would, he was still going to work at select snacks because he wouldn’t give up and I would go to work with him and after work he would let me grab a drink and a snack as his way of paying me for coming to work with him, I was only able to go to work with I’m on the day I stayed the night round there house which one I did I had a really nice time. My grandad every night for tea when I was there wouldn’t even have to ask me what I would want he knew of the top of his head, his homemade Mac and cheese. The nights I would stay round I would always wake up and go in the living room and see him sat that in his arm chair whatching the news in a button up shirt and jeans at six in the morning !!! Sadly once my grandad had finished chemotherapy he lost all his hair and always wore a hat to cover it up even in his house the only times he would take it of was sleeping and showering. My grandad loved his gardening more then anything other then my Nan. But as time went past he became weaker and struggled to get about but this didn’t make him give up. All in his garden he would have bits and bobs to help him do things a lot easier like when he had chicken to stop him having to go in he would send me in, I’m joking he would have a string to pull to let them in and out and grab the eggs they had layed. Even though he was getting weaker and becoming slower at walking and struggling he would always make time for everyone especially me. There’s one memory that will always stay with me and that’s the time he took me darts at the Addison arms pub in glatton we drove in his blue Ford and went in the back half sat down I got a apple and raspberry j2o and he got himself a cider we got the darts out and played he beat me at another thing. Sooner or later his hair grew back and he took his hat off and this meant a lot as it was a massive step for him that he was able to take . After 2 years having cancer my grandad was still winning and was still being able to do his favourite things like going to the pub and gardening. It’s was 1.5 years ago now and I still remeber this strongly, it was a wet Sunday night my mum and dad had gone to the pub with some friends and I was having a really emotional night to the put were I had enough and I ran out my front doors and into the rain and just sat on the curb my nan and grandad then came and got me and my nan went inside and went to check on everyone as billie was baby sitting but my grandad Ill and in pain came and gave me a hug and stood out in the rain with me. He took me round his house that night and he made us fish fingers and chips and beans and we sat in the conservatory and ate on his circular table and ate he tooked to me about my problems and worry’s and put a smile to my face. As time passed to fast my grandad got worse and was back in hospital and we got told his cancer had spread to his spine and paralysed him. The good news was he didn’t have to stay in hospital and he was able to come home so my Nan got their bedroom re done and able for him to stay in and he had a hospital bed a tv and more stuff in there for his needs. Then lockdown happend causing my family unable to see him but eventually we were able to and it was tuff as he was stuck in bed. During lockdown me and my Nan decided to re do there whole garden as it was over grown and mud from the chickens so we did we spent months on it making it grass and open space. Then it was my grandads 70th birthday my whole family went down and sat in the garden and we were able to get my grandad out in his wheel chair and he was able to see his garden never like it was before and he really liked it we also planted flowers out of the front of there garden so my grandad could look out the window and whatch them grow. Now times got tuff as he was taking turns but he was able to over come them all except one which was horrible my grandads legs were in so much pain and so was he until his nurses decided to put him on medicine that what get rid of all of that pain but the side effect was he just slept all day everyday this lasted for 2 weeks and my mum and auntie speant the last two weeks of his life with him. October the 14th, I came home from school and my uncles car was out the front and I knew something was up as I ran in the door and saw my mum and sister crying and my uncle sat there I knew what had happened I instantly went from smiling to my heart had shattered into a million pieces it was devastating and I had lost my grandad. But I remember all the memories I have with him and that’s massive as I don’t think about what I didn’t do with him I think about what I did with him. </p><p>That’s my story with my grandads battle of cancer for 4 years and I want to give back to Macmillan for helping out so much and I would like to give back a little something so if you could please donate even a pound that would mean so much to me :).</p>",Alfie 's  150 miles for Macmillan,0,0,50,50,0,820151,Charlie  Owen ,/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/13536661,remember/820151,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Alfie 150 miles walk run bike ,https://www.justgiving.com/Alfie-gardiner,/Alfie-gardiner,United Kingdom,...Alfie 's  150 miles for <strong>Macmillan</strong>...,Alfie 's  150 miles for Macmillan,//images.justgiving.com/image/94e1f805-267b-476f-a8d4-e04dff42aa86.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,17.214197,Alfie  Gardiner ,Running walking and biking 150  miles,From December 1st till January 30th,2020-11-17T16:59:27,2116,6354322,2020-12-01T00:00:00,100,13507,683d7038-1a25-412c-8128-eb4ec465a976,Macmillan Cancer Support,2116,261017,2116,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2020-11-23T06:28:21Z

Then when a close friend of my sons family where hit by this awful disease I wanted to do something to really bring notice to this horrible disease and push myself that little bit further. I began running and each race I ran a little bit further. I realised could do something epic in my little life of being a Mummy - Run an Ultra every month till September 2021 when I will be 40.

It is devastating for both the sufferer and their family. Research and funding is really making a difference, and if we can support that further and tell cancer to fuck off, then i am more than happy to be a part of it. Cancer has come back to affect people i know and love since then, but most have give it the middle finger and beat it. For all of you, i want to help. And this is my way of doing it. Please sponsor not just me, but the whole brigade that is building against this horrible bastard. I just want to make it clear that this distance is way out of my league, and won't hit it.

After this devastating news we thought this would be a good way to mix a great deed with something we love to do which is game. We appreciate any help and support and any donations as little as £1 go a long way. A massive thank you in advance and hope you guys support us in this 24hr stream!

I know people close to me that have lost someone dear to them, I know people who are suffering from cancer.  I can't really do much scientifically but there is one thing that I can do and that's play video games for a VERY long time.  I've wanted to do something for a cancer charity for a long time and now this is a good opportunity for me to raise some money for a good cause AND have fun whilst doing it.  I will post on Tik Tok, Insta and Snapchat making an announcement for this event and will be live streaming on twitch! Come watch and, if possible, make a donation or share with your friends and family and get the word out.

And now my beautiful cousin is currently going through chemo to beat it! She’s  an incredibly brave woman and I admire how positive she is.

It has been truly remarkable to see the support St John has provided the NHS so far and how quickly that support was generated.</p><p>In the fight against coronavirus St John Ambulance volunteers are on the frontline, standing alongside our brave NHS. St John urgently need funds to put more first aiders and ambulance crews into communities up and down the country.</p><p><span>St John Ambulance saves lives every day and as we face the extraordinary demands of this ongoing health emergency resources are stretched like never before and we need your support right now.  </span><span>With your help we will continue to support communities after the crisis by training young people and adults to learn lifesaving first aid including the right preparation to ensure our volunteers can help the nation in emergencies whenever they need us. St John also need to keep its fleet on the road and Ambulances need to be replaced and upgraded, this is where you can really help and where my bid to run the next London Marathon will hopefully make a difference.</span></p><p>There has been a long family association with St John with both my Grandfather Jack Petersen, a great boxer in his day, and my father John. It seemed only right for me to try to follow in their footsteps, quite literally in this case!  </p><p>Plans to run the 2020 London Marathon for St John changed somewhat as a result of Covid-19 with the vast majority of runners taking part in a 'virtual event'.  I too took to the streets on a dark, wet and miserable Sunday afternoon to complete the 26.2 miles around the streets of Newbury, sadly without the crowds and atmosphere to distract me from the rain, wind and rather sore feet.  Proudly wearing my St John vest as I made my way around the course it was heartening to see and hear so many people stop, wave, clap and honk their horns in support, thank you one and all!</p><p>Many of you have kindly offered to support me having successfully completed the 2020 virtual event, but now we switch focus to 2021 Marathon and the real fundraising effort begins.  This time, fingers crossed, I will again take to the streets of London, and with<span> the weight of support of the Oxfordshire Priory Group behind me, we hope to raise as much as we can to support the St John emergency campaign.  Raising £10,000 would make a huge difference in the campaign but just imagine if we could raise a whopping £104,000, the cost of a brand new Ambulance! Oh yes, and at the same time, I really must </span><span>beat my rather modest PB of 5 Hrs 11 minutes, surely 5th time lucky!</span></p><p>You no doubt would want to know what impact your donation might make, so here are some examples outlining what specific donation amounts could help fund:</p><p><strong>£100 could help us urgently up-skill and train volunteers.</strong></p><p>Your support could help our many volunteers who need additional training in order to work safely with patients in ambulances, hospitals and in communities during this national emergency. You could also help us to train new volunteers and fast-track them through tailored training courses and continue this work long term.</p><p><strong>£500 could support our volunteer operations to make sure they can respond quickly.</strong></p><p>In this urgent crisis your support could be the difference between a life lost and a life saved. With your help we can make sure our volunteers and staff are connected at all times and are able to respond quickly to a fast-moving situation.</p><p><strong>£1,000+ will support the future of St John Ambulance’s work through COVID-19 and beyond.</strong></p><p>Our role in communities and across the country has never been more vital and with your help we will save lives. Your support will enable us to continue to be the nation’s leading community health and first aid charity.</p><p><strong>£104,000+ will pay for the delivery of a brand new Ambulance to help support St John Ambulance’s work through COVID-19 and beyond.</strong></p><p><strong>St John and COVID-19</strong><br/></p><p>The number of coronavirus cases and deaths in the country continues to rise with significant impact on and stretching of NHS resources. During the COVID-19 outbreak, St John is actively supporting ambulance services, hospitals and communities to protect life and health through this worrying and uncertain period.</p><p>“St John Ambulance is facing extraordinary demands, the likes of which our organisation has not faced in peacetime. Our charity’s resources are being stretched, and our people are being tested, but we will stop at nothing to help beat this virus.” Richard Lee, Chief Operating Officer and COVID Strategic Commander</p><p>Right now, St John is stepping forward to save lives, with thousands of fully trained volunteers. We are supporting the NHS to care for people during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our charity’s vital role responding to the needs of communities across the nation has never been more relevant or urgent.</p><p>St John volunteers are supporting patients right now in the NHS Nightingale Hospital in London, and in hospital emergency departments up and down the country caring for those in need. As more Nightingale hospitals open our volunteers stand ready to do more. Our volunteer ambulance crews are also working 24/7 supporting 999 call outs and transporting recovered patients back home safely.</p><p>So please dig deep, spread the word and let’s do all we can to smash the initial £10,000 target and who knows, perhaps we might even get to the magic £104,000 dream goal! Thank you for anything you can spare and I promise to pull my finger out and make sure my marathon time starts with a 4...!!</p><p>A huge thank you for all your help,</p><p>Matt</p></div><div id=""userStoryReadmore"" class=""collapse"" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"">Read less</div><div id=""display_story_images"" class=""col-sm-12 m-t-16 m-b-8 p-a-0 userGallery"" style=""float: left;width: 670px;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);""></div><div id=""shareMyStory"" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51);""><div class=""m-b-36""></div></div><p></p>",Matt's page,12.50,0,50,1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,London Marathon 2021,https://www.justgiving.com/Matt-Petersen2,/Matt-Petersen2,United Kingdom,,Matt's page,//images.justgiving.com/image/213b1cb5-2fab-43eb-804c-953fc4484134.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,14.261076,Matt Petersen,Raising money to fight the battle against Covid-19,St John volunteers directly support the NHS,2020-11-21T10:38:08,11205,5246239,2021-10-03T00:00:00,10000,13540,513a78f9-3211-434b-a63b-bdffad9152b0,St John Ambulance,11205,1077265,11205,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2020-11-23T06:28:21Z

All 750 BHF shops were forced to close and dozens of fundraising events remain cancelled. The BHF has been losing over £10 million a month and devastatingly, they may need to cut their research budget in half this year. Heart and circulatory diseases remain the world’s biggest killers affecting millions of people worldwide. They don’t disappear because of a global pandemic. They continue to cause heartbreak on a devastating scale and that is why TSA are very proud to be supporting the BHF this Christmas by taking part in their Elf Kick Challenge.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p>",TSA British Heart Foundation Virtual Collection,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,50f74d1d-0aba-46e7-8d79-49154c1c0a3c,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Virtual Collections,https://www.justgiving.com/TSAElfKick2020,/TSAElfKick2020,United Kingdom,...TSA <strong>British</strong> <strong>Heart</strong> <strong>Foundation</strong> Virtual Collection...,TSA British Heart Foundation Virtual Collection,//images.justgiving.com/image/77c208ba-62d2-416f-9e4a-d886fa6f498a.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,30.048899,The Skipton Academy,TSA pupils are taking part in the BHF Elf Kick,it is a charity close to our hearts,2020-11-19T11:25:18,183092,5989361,2020-12-31T00:00:00,500,641389,dcf1232e-aa61-40c6-8cc7-7d19b5105862,British Heart Foundation,183092,225971,183092,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2020-11-23T06:28:21Z

The Coronavirus Pandemic this year has significantly impacted the monies being donated to these worthwhile charities - money that is desperately needed to continue research and support functions of those charities.

Therefore the PENTEN and OITC teams have proposed a ""Virtual"" event where people may take part on the same day but in their own time whilst maintaining social distancing rules

OCD shift workers may also choose a different day to take part

Therefore for 2020 we will be raising money for the British Heart Foundation There is a choice of three events - indoor or outdoor

Cycling

Challenge 1 - Minimum 20 miles

Challenge 2 - Minimum 50 miles

Running

Challenge 1 - Minimum 5K

Challenge 2 - Minimum 10K

Walking

Challenge 1 - Minimum 5K

Challenge 2 - Minimum 10K

The event will take part on the 28th November 2020

So please join the Team and raise money as much money as possible for an extremely worthwhile cause

There is a small joining fee of £10 which of course will go towards the total raised.

So please register and Join in have fun and support a worthy cause!!!

At first I didn't think I needed a guide dog, I guess I was in denial about how much my sight had deteriorated. However a bad experience at Epsom races changed my attitude. It was supposed to be a fun day out with the family but the huge crowds made me really anxious. We ended up leaving early becuase I couldn't cope and thought I was going to walk into everyone. For weeks afterwards I felt low and socially I didn't feel comfortable.</span></p><p><span>I admitted to myself that I needed some help, and a<span style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);float: none;"">fter a chat with Brenda</span> we decided to contact Guide Dogs. The support I recieved during the application process alone made a huge difference. While waiting on a guide dog I recieved long cane training which helped me </span><span>recover my independence and </span><span>taught me numerous skills to enable me to get out and about safely despite my </span><span>loss of vision.</span><span>  </span><span>I am hugely grateful to the Newcastle Guide Dogs team who</span><span> helped me to accept my sight loss and who gave me the </span><span>skills and confidence to get out and about again and live life without limits.</span></p><p><span>In 2017 I was matched to my guide dog Hannah, a yellow Labrador, and we bonded immediately!

Infant leukaemia (affecting babies diagnosed before the age of one), has been described as ‘A thorn in the side of a remarkable success story’. Although there have been incredible improvements for childhood leukaemia over the past twenty years - where survival rates are as high as 90%,  the main type of leukaemia affecting babies, is still not well understood and remains hard to treat.<br/><br/>GOSH are looking to find a cure for this aggressive disease and find alternative treatments to the particularly high-dose chemotherapy used in its standard treatment, and also bone marrow transplants, which in themselves carry a 10-20% fatality rate for these patients.<br/></p><p>As always if you are not able to donate, please consider signing up as a blood donor! #Blood4Enzo </p>",The Grape Gals Holiday Tasting,5,0,20,2,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,true,true,NA,04979084-ec4c-4569-ae6e-732a44a4e69d,NA,enzo,NA,NA,NA,The Grape Gals : A Holiday Wine Tasting,https://www.justgiving.com/grapegalsholidaytasting,/grapegalsholidaytasting,Bermuda,,The Grape Gals Holiday Tasting,//images.justgiving.com/image/10e0990e-f69a-482a-96b6-23aadc034c2f.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,12.326593,Paige Thompson,NA,NA,2020-11-19T13:35:31,254,6355932,2020-12-21T12:00:00,1000,12057,4af5a34d-31f1-4a66-837d-98013ca7463f,Great Ormond Street Hospital,254,1160024,254,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2020-11-23T06:28:21Z

Our new Never Far Away: Essex Appeal aims to raise vital funds to support parent and family accommodation at GOSH. £300,000 will give families precious nights close to their children whilst they receive treatment at GOSH. We are asking the people of Essex to get behind this appeal, together we can make a massive difference to the families who are going through a very stressful time, if we can ease one worry then it is worth it. Whether you can raise £1 or £100; it will make an impact to so many families. A 7-night stay for 2 adults in a budget hotel 15 minutes from the hospital would cost a staggering £815. This is simply not affordable for most families.Find out more at www.gosh.org/NeverFarAway </p><p>At Basking Babies we’ve been running events to raise money for this vital appeal for the past couple of years and did not want multiple lockdowns during 2020 to stop us! </p><p>During the month of December we’ll be asking mums to dress up their babies in something Christmassy across all our Baby Massage and Baby Yoga classes in Essex.

My Dad and I have been through so much together, more than most fathers and sons I'd say, and I feel it is my duty to be with him at this time. My Mum also succumbed to this horrible disease at a relatively early age and I know in talking to you, the glorious parents over the years, some of you have your own life experiences with this wretched disease. I have been supporting  Cancer Research for many years and I feel the greater the opportunity they have to find those elusive cures, the brighter the future will look.  My target, represents ten pounds for each year I have been associated with Bowbrook (try and work that one out...) plus of course, 300 is a special number for me, for the eagle-eyed car- spotters amongst you. </p><p>THANK YOU (a big thank you...) to my awesome colleagues, my many friends, to your fabulous children, to you the parents (past and present) for making my journey at Bowbrook incredibly memorable, and one special, heartfelt thank you to Mr and Mrs Allen, without whom none of this, in fact any of it, would be possible for any of us!

He underwent major operations and received intensive chemo and radiotherapy treatment. He made a remarkable recovery and was able to enjoy and get on with his life. <br/><br/>Sadly, in September 2019 he was informed he had developed secondary anal cancer. He made the decision to have an intense course of radiotherapy which really took its toll on him. He slowly began to improve and seemed to be getting stronger but over Christmas/New Year 2019 he became unwell. He had a DVT and had also developed an infection. <br/><br/>On January 16th I sat with Dad and Chriss (his Wife) while Doctors discussed his future treatment. The prognosis was not good, the cancer was spreading and the infection had taken hold. Dad made the extremely brave decision to decline any further treatment. His wish was that he wanted to go home to die but we were told it would take a number of days to get things in place and he may only have a few days once his treatment was stopped. <br/></i></span></p><p style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);text-align: left;""><span><i><!--StartFragment--><span style=""float: none;background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245);color: rgb(38, 38, 38);text-align: left;""><i>Dad surprised us all, as a week later he was still with us and even had discussions with the palliative care team about getting him home from hospital.</i></span><br style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);text-align: left;""/><i></i><br style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);text-align: left;""/><i></i><span style=""float: none;background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245);color: rgb(38, 38, 38);text-align: left;""><i>We started preparing for his homecoming on the 23rd January.

We support the NHS by providing frontline care. We provide vital bereavement support for family and friends. And we help the nation prepare for death, to help makes things better at the end.<br/><br/>Last year we helped more than 60,000 people directly and reached over two million more. Marie Curie Nurses care for people in their homes,<br/>giving much-needed respite to overstretched carers. Our nine hospices offer the reassurance of specialist care and support in a friendly, welcoming environment – so people can feel safe and cared-for in their final months, weeks and days of life. Our trusted information and support line help people in their hour of need to feel reassured, informed and empowered to face what’s happening in their lives.

Marie Curie is able to provide frontline nursing and hospice care, a free support line and a wealth of information and support on all aspects of dying, death and bereavement. The money which is raised will go directly to caring services, research and campaigning for better end of life care. Remember every penny counts!</p><p>There is no better way for me to fundraise, than a trek. Since I can remember my mum has been telling me stories of the adventures she had and in 2016, we walked over 300 miles for the World Land Trust, but this time I am going bigger and better. I am super excited to tackle this incredible mountain and any contributions to the work of Marie Curie we can gather in the process will be greatly appreciated!</p><p>To keep up with my fundraising efforts and adventures please do keep an eye on this page as well as follow my instagram <b>@adventures4mariecurie</b>.</p><p><b><u>Thank you again for all your generous support! </u></b></p><p>Lots of Love</p><p>Bella xoxo</p>",Bella's Kilimanjaro Trek,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,true,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Kilimanjaro - LSE,https://www.justgiving.com/ArabellaWoo,/ArabellaWoo,United Kingdom,,Bella's Kilimanjaro Trek,//images.justgiving.com/image/34dcb0f2-8ef5-457a-9f85-57ed8981b754.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,21.520454,Arabella Woo,"I will be climbing Mt Kilimanjaro, Tanzania",NA,2020-11-18T16:14:20,50,6355189,2020-11-18T16:14:20,3890,12130,94e071ca-9dab-4389-b327-581e9f6764af,Marie Curie,50,207994,50,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2020-11-23T06:28:21Z

Every single day at the hospice is an extraordinary day. 

We listen, support and give high-quality care during what can be a difficult, challenging and distressing time. And we get to know people as individuals, find out what makes them happy, and help to make those things happen.

That might mean sitting with them in the hospice garden, or arranging for their pet to visit them at the hospice. We focus on the special things that bring people joy.

We also provide important support for carers and families, including bereavement support and counselling.

We need to raise £6,150 per day to run the hospice, so every penny counts. Thank you for helping to make sure more people with a terminal illness in and around Belfast, get the care and support they need.

And the RNLI safety teams and educators working tirelessly to stop people getting into trouble in the first place.Thank you.</p>",Charles's Icebreaker,26.25,0,190,38,0,820536,Raymond Parsons,/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/13541856,remember/820536,NA,true,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Icebreaker,https://www.justgiving.com/Charles-Parsons19,/Charles-Parsons19,United Kingdom,,Charles's Icebreaker,//images.justgiving.com/image/f5a3ecfa-3d79-44cb-a58c-5da027c7a4ca.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,19.817492,Charles Parsons,I am swimming in a frozen lake in Westbury,NA,2020-11-19T13:06:57,11200,6357838,2020-12-26T00:00:00,500,13270,92c280d1-2530-4df0-8a4c-d7285c96cbac,RNLI - Royal National Lifeboat Institution,11200,209603,11200,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2020-11-23T06:28:21Z

This is a challenge faced daily for approximately 11.3% of the world's population including children. Every minute, more than five child mortalities can be attributed to malnutrition. For those fortunate to survive, malnutrition has detrimental effects on childhood growth and learning abilities.

Through FAST 24, Lancaster University students will go without food on 27th November to raise money for UNICEF's emergency food programmes.

The United Nation's International Children's Emergency UNICEF is a charity part of the United Nation's Development Group committed to protection of children worldwide. UNICEF provides 80% of the world's life-saving food through its nutrition programmes.
