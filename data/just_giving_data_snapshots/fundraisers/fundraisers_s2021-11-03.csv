But they can't do it alone. Macmillan is facing a huge drop in income as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Because 97% of their work is funded by people like us, they need our support now more than ever.

Right now, millions of people with cancer are counting on Macmillan for physical, financial and emotional support. At Macmillan, they do whatever it takes – last year was no exception. But they can't do it alone. Macmillan is facing a huge drop in income as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Because 97% of their work is funded by people like us, they need our support now more than ever.

Every little bit helps. Thank you for your support. Below is some information about Macmillan Cancer Support. <br/>There’s around 3 million people living with cancer in the UK today, and over 360,000 more are diagnosed every year. Right now, millions of people with cancer are counting on Macmillan for physical, financial and emotional support.<br/>At Macmillan, they do whatever it takes – last year was no exception. But they can't do it alone. Macmillan is facing a huge drop in income as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Because 97% of their work is funded by people like us, they need our support now more than ever.

Living with cancer can be devastating at the best of times, but even harder as a result of the recent pandemic.  At Macmillan, we talk to people affected by cancer every day and for many, issues with money and mental health such as stress and depression, are their biggest worry.

Our partnership focuses on tackling financial hardship and loneliness together, helping Macmillan develop their telephone, online and virtual support services and to help thousands more people with much needed financial and emotional support.

The CBRE partnership is going to be more important than ever before, to help Macmillan do whatever it takes to support every single person living with cancer.

Cancer is not going anywhere.  And neither can Macmillan.

This winter may be our toughest yet and I am helping to bring some community spirit by sharing my sparkle by supporting St John. 

St John volunteers treat and transport thousands of patients each year, and in times of crisis we are England's national health reserve.  

During the pandemic our skilled and highly trained volunteers are working long shifts supporting sick people and their families, in hospitals, in ambulances and at home. We are proud to be working alongside the nations ambulance trusts and in hospitals around the country.

He was so eager to begin his life that he rocked up a couple of weeks early, and very very quickly! You can imagine how happy and excited we all were.</p><p>However, it became apparent very soon after his birth that something was not right. When trying to feed him he didn't seem to be able to take my milk down and he was going blue and finding it difficult to breathe. </p><p>After we raised the alarm 3 or 4 times, a few hours after his birth he was taken to the hospital's intensive care unit to be assessed and monitored. <span>The consultant diagnosed that he had a rare condition that affect's the babies oesophagus ( food pipe) and </span>trachea ( windpipe) called TOF/OA<span> ( </span>Tracheo-Oesophageal Fistula and an Oesohageal Artresia).</p><p>Basically his oesophagus <span>from his mouth didn't reach his stomach so he couldn't swallow anything. And the part of his oesophagus that was attached to his stomach was attached to his trachea, so acid, air and fluid in </span>his<span> </span>stomach<span> was going into his lungs so he couldn't breathe properly.</span></p><p><span>He required urgent surgery to correct these abnormalities. </span></p><p>We were so blessed that we lived in London and Great Ormond Street Hospital was on our doorstep so he was rushed late that night by ambulance to this truly wonderful place. Very early the following morning he underwent major surgery. Our tiny newborn baby had a 4 hour operation to join his oesophagus together and close up the resultant hole in his trachea.</p><p>We thought that everything was 'fixed' and that he would be fine. However, at 2.00am the following morning we received an urgent call from the ICU advising that the procedure had to be redone as there had been complications. His lungs collapsed and he was extremely poorly.</p><p>The staff at GOSH were unbelievably amazing. They helped both Kenny and I to cope with an absolutely terrifying situation, providing a safe and reassuring environment for us both when we were both completely lost. They saved Zack's life on more than one occasion and continued caring for him regularly, both when he had to be readmitted due to illness and through regular out patient appointments to monitor his development right up to the age of 10.</p><p>Kenny and I cannot thank GOSH enough for saving Zack's life. I want to raise as much money as I can for the staff and hospital, so that they can help as many children and their families as possible. I'm therefore running the London Landmark's 1/2 marathon next April with my sister Sal for the GOSH charity.</p><p>I would really appreciate any donation that you can give to support the phenomenal GOSH staff and all the  hospital's initiatives. As an example of how your money will help, we were put up in a room round the corner from the hospital for the days that Zack was in ICU so that we could be with him. This was funded through charity donations. The money also goes towards research, life saving equipment, building and refurbishment and supporting all the families and children that are dealing with extremely frightening and life threatening conditions.</p><p>A HUGE THANK YOU to you all for your kindness and generosity.</p><p>Much love </p><p>Julia X</p><p><br/></p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

Thank you for visiting my JustGiving page.</p><p>I'm so proud to say that I've been selected to be a part of Team GOSH for the London Marathon in October 2022 to help raise money for the hospital and a cause very close to my heart.</p><p>You may or may not know that this isn't actually my first time being part of Team GOSH. I was a patient at the hospital for just over 15 years from around the ages of 3-18. The hospital is a truly unique place and has undoubtedly played a big role in shaping the person I am today.<br/></p><p>Mine is just one story of gratitude, but it's certainly not one that is individual to me. Every day, 619 children and young people from across the UK arrive at Great Ormond Street Hospital. Every day, doctors and nurses battle some of the most complex illnesses and work together to achieve pioneering medical breakthroughs. Despite the complexities and seriousness of all the work going on, what really makes GOSH unique and something that has always stuck with me is that time for fun, laughter and creating a space for kids to be kids is never lost sight of. Smiles are infectious and  every visit to the hospital was an overwhelmingly positive experience despite the often painful and uncomfortable treatments which I was there for.<br/></p><p>One thing you will definitely know about me is that I'm not a runner. A mixture of genuine concern to straight out laughter has been the general reaction to me telling my friends I was thinking of doing the marathon with a special mention to &#34;You are the last person I would think of to be doing a marathon&#34; from the big DC.</p><p>This is going to be a real challenge for me, however one that I couldn't think of a better cause to do it for. Ever since leaving GOSH 7 years ago, I have always wanted to do something to say thank you for the care, support and experience I received at Great Ormond Street and to help support it to give the same to thousands of other children every year. Being selected for Team GOSH has enabled me to go a small way in doing this.

Every single day at the hospice is an extraordinary day. And every moment is precious. Our hospice nurses, doctors and therapists provide the best possible care for people with serious illnesses, and offer vital emotional support for them and their families. 

The hospice is a warm, welcoming place where loved ones can be together in peaceful surroundings and in as much comfort as possible. Whether it's for one day or several weeks, the time people spend at the hospice is precious, and is cherished by them and their families.

Thank you for supporting us, and helping to make sure more people with a terminal illness in North London get the care and support they need.

My challenge will support WWF, who are the world's leading independent conservation organisation with the mission to create a world where people and wildlife can thrive together. I'm supporting WWF because we are the first generation that knows we are destroying the world, and the last that can do anything about it. Our planet is suffering but together we can make a difference and fight for our world.  

That is why any donation big or small, sharing my fundraising page, or even just spreading awareness of WWF is hugely appreciated! 

Thank you for all your support.
