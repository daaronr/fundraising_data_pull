That diagnosis has a massive impact on that persons family and friends. At the end of 2020, my father was diagnosed with Colorectal cancer for which he has had to undergo operations and is currently having Chemotherapy. His battle is not his to fight alone; it is being fought every day by his family and friends around him - and it is a battle we will win.  The work of Macmillan Cancer Support has been nothing shy of amazing in the support, care and advice they can give, and it is an honour to be able to raise money for them. Every day, cancer patients face an enormous mental and physical battle, and over the course of their treatment undergo hardship and pain unimaginable to those without Cancer. In light of this, I will be running the Brighton Half Marathon in under 1 hour 30 minutes (a difficult challenge) so that I too can get a glimpse of the hardship that others have to endure every day. Cancer does not discriminate against age, gender or race - you never know if or when you, a family member or a friend might be diagnosed. If you can, please spare a penny, a pound or even ten pounds as it will help support the Charity that make the battle against Cancer that little bit easier and help swing the odds ever in your favour.  </p>",Michael's Half Marathon Fundraiser for Macmillan Cancer Support,40,0,250,71,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Brighton Half Marathon 2021,https://www.justgiving.com/Michael-McGeough7,/Michael-McGeough7,United Kingdom,...Michael's Half Marathon Fundraiser for <strong>Macmillan</strong> <strong>Cancer</strong>...,Michael's Half Marathon Fundraiser for Macmillan Cancer Support,//images.justgiving.com/image/0e525490-a829-4085-a8a7-dcb25e53a1ad.png?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,20.320417,Michael  McGeough ,2021-03-08T12:19:35,2116,5963129,2021-06-27T00:00:00,350,12126,121e2000-20b7-4ada-9209-a7640e909895,I am going to run the Brighton Half Marathon,the support and help they offer is truely amazing,Macmillan Cancer Support,2116,261017,2116,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-03-12T07:08:21Z

I would be so grateful for any donation, no matter how big or small, and can’t say thank you enough for supporting me and supporting the fantastic work that this charity does.</span><!--EndFragment--><br/><br/></p>",Louis's 200km in March,0,0,71.62,72,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Lou's 200km in March,https://www.justgiving.com/Louis-Hemmersley,/Louis-Hemmersley,United Kingdom,,Louis's 200km in March,//images.justgiving.com/image/9ff2319a-1b15-44fc-b451-fca773860638.png?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,15.215517,Louis Hemmersley,2021-03-08T10:19:23,2116,6568377,2021-03-08T10:19:23,100,13507,c4d013be-a0f8-491b-b6fa-61bc71837f3a,Throughout March I will be running 200km in total,we all know someone who's been affected by cancer,Macmillan Cancer Support,2116,261017,2116,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-03-12T07:08:21Z

And one of my best friends Sheila, got diagnosed with cancer in 2018 and is using MacMillan who have been amazing so I thought I should just combine the two and make me HAVE to do this. </p><p>To put this total in context, I walked 1409 miles in 2020, starting because it was lockdown, and while I was working 8 hours a day, sat on my bum, at a desk, I had these 2 additional hours where I was not commuting. This worked well until I twisted my ankle and it never recovered properly. But I carried on anyway (as you do) until the end of October 2020 when I had major surgery and my ligament was rebuilt, cartilage was removed, and ankle was micro-fractured to replace it. That meant no putting my foot down for 6 weeks and no serious walking until after 12 weeks. </p><p>1409 miles from April to October… 2021 miles should be a “walk in the park”.</p><p>I worked out 2021 miles is about 5.5/12500 miles/steps a day – I was ok doing 5 miles already so ½ a mile was not going to be a challenge was it? Er… well…. If you factor in, I could not actually cover any distance in January, and if I go back to work I gain a 2-hour commute (lose my walking time), and I hate walking in the rain… it’s an actual challenge. </p><p>But its ok – I have a spreadsheet… and I am monitoring. Its currently March 7<sup>th</sup> – Since Jan 1st I have walked 705,821 steps against a target of 865,896 which is only 69 miles short… I will keep you updated… yes its a serious spreadsheet. </p><p>And to be clear this is a “all in” steps challenge. I have a Fitbit counting my steps. If I am working, I do about 1000 steps across the course of the day (mostly answering the door to pick up another Amazon parcel) so it is mostly me making an effort to go out and actually walk. </p><p>So please donate, please donate all you can for those with cancer and need this service. They have helped so many people I know and love, and will continue to do so for a very long time. </p><p>Thank you very much</p><p>Gemma</p><p>PS My dog hates me, he is knackered… </p><p>PPS It is a year long challenge so I can bug you for donations until Jan 2022 just as we go back into lockdown... </p><p></p>",2021 in 2021,35,0,160,8,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2021 Miles in 2021,https://www.justgiving.com/GemmaSWalker,/GemmaSWalker,United Kingdom,,2021 in 2021,//images.justgiving.com/image/dd14d52e-fe4b-46bd-99c3-a28b795bea1f.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,15.215517,Gemma Walker,2021-03-10T08:11:46,2116,6571429,2021-03-10T08:11:45,2021,13507,8b009cdc-3445-43a8-b049-ed85e3557517,I am walking 2021 Miles across 2021,they do such an awesome job,Macmillan Cancer Support,2116,261017,2116,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-03-12T07:08:21Z

That’s almost 2 marathons in 2 days.</p><p style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Despite its simplicity, the 4x4x48 is a pressing test of resilience, endurance and willpower. Whilst 4 miles isn’t a major strain for most athletes, it’s the frequency of needing to run them which makes this challenge tough.</p><p style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Because you have to put in 4 miles every 4 hours, you can’t get quality sleep. Sure, you might get the odd two and a half hours but the alarm bell will soon ring ordering you out of the comfortable bed and into the running shoes for another 4 miles.</p><p style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Some find the wear and tear on the body particularly difficult. The first three or four 4-mile runs will be fine for most athletes but the constant running will soon result wear you out. Your muscles will start feeling sorer as the challenge progresses, and each run will become harder to maintain than the last.</p><p style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">The 4x4x48 challenge is also tough due to the willpower required. It’s easy to motivate yourself to run once or maybe even twice in a day but having to do so 12 times in 2 days is a sheer willpower test. Whilst you may be reading this thinking ‘easy, I’ll be able to take that on’, I guarantee you that (from personal experience) it’s a totally different conversation you’ll have with yourself when it’s 4AM on the second day and you’re exhausted.</p>",Chris / Anthony / Scott / Leon 4x4x48,30,0,120,0,0,NA,true,true,NA,NA,NA,NA,13e0e2d0-0596-476c-9fea-9652b98e12b0,Letsgo4x4x48,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4x4x48,https://www.justgiving.com/Chris-J-Allsopp,/Chris-J-Allsopp,United Kingdom,,Chris / Anthony / Scott / Leon 4x4x48,//images.justgiving.com/image/65c01a5c-b5c8-4fbd-8467-5d9f9c5a55af.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,13.780699,Chris Allsopp,2021-03-03T08:11:44,2116,6556901,2021-03-05T12:00:00,0,13507,f04924a6-ae6f-42dc-be06-4dc262753c48,NA,NA,Macmillan Cancer Support,2116,261017,2116,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-03-12T07:08:21Z

We wouldn’t have know about them if it wasn’t for Macmillan.”</i></p><p><br></p><p>The Coronavirus pandemic hasn’t changed how important charities such as Macmillan are but it has impacted the amount of donations that they have received over the past year because many fundraising events have not been able to take place. A gaming marathon is something that we are able to do in the current climate and we hope we will be able to make a small difference. Obviously being the fine athletes that&nbsp;&nbsp;we are we would prefer to be running marathons or competing in an Iron Man triathlon but with the Coronavirus pandemic this just isn’t possible.</p><p>We will be making it a little bit harder this year by increasing the event from 24 hours to 26.2 hours to make it a true marathon. Starting at 06:00 on Friday 19th&nbsp;March and running through until 08:12 on Saturday 20th&nbsp;March. We will have a 10 minute break every 2 hours but the rest will be non-stop gaming. It might sound like fun but 24 hours has been a really difficult when we have done it before so 26.2 is really going to be a challenge.</p><p>The athletes taking part are:</p><p>Tommyrouse</p><p>le_spuff</p><p>LucasRAF</p><p>Si-mon119</p><p>Gibinstine69&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you in advance for your kind donations!</p>",EzPz Gaming Marathon,61.25,0,375,75,0,NA,true,true,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4e16216c-8215-4aaa-a2cf-72f26f4b5567,NA,NA,NA,Game Heroes 2021,https://www.justgiving.com/ez-pz-gaming-marathon,/ez-pz-gaming-marathon,United Kingdom,,EzPz Gaming Marathon,//images.justgiving.com/image/f47ebbf4-657d-414e-9991-db5d56e705db.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,10.865577,EzPz .,2021-03-10T14:56:38,2116,6510236,2021-03-01T00:00:00,500,13507,2f05c246-4743-4398-be8a-e9ee07557bd7,NA,NA,Macmillan Cancer Support,2116,261017,2116,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-03-12T07:08:21Z

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak our volunteers have given an incredible number of hours of support to patients in hospitals across the country, and we are not stopping. Throughout Spring we are continuing to mobilise thousands of volunteers to support the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination.

At my 20 weeks scan we were giving news that ripped our hearts out no parent or mummy wants to hear. Our little Lilly had a health condition. As I got scans after scans about her heart Condition, it really is amazing what they can do before birth. We were very lucky as when Lilly was born they found out her heart condition wasn't as severe as they first thought. However, her heart is still very poorly but she was stable. We have recieved the best care she needed to be stable, until she got to the weight they wanted her to be, so they can fix her large hole (VSD) and anything else that needs fixed. To being told it is a VSD that needs fixed to being told at 23 weeks she needed a whole repair, you can imagine how the positives are what we hold onto each day. </p><p>Lilly struggles a lot but she is still stable and everyday she proves doctors wrong and shows how much she just carries on achieving new milestones everyday.  We are so proud of her and how brave she is at only 5 months. It is amazing how resilient babies and kids are and we see this everyday with our girl. It has been tough, a few scary moments but she has bounced back and really thriving.  Lilly has a heart veering to the right  (dextrocardia) A large hole  (VSD) and I think Transportation of the great arteries (TGA) It is very complex as their main <span>concern is the large VSD. Bless her, so scans are every complex but all doctors have managed so well. Anyway I could go and on about our Lilly as she is our miracle fighter from day one! </span></p><p><span>So please, if you are able to help give a little to families with loved ones that have CHD, we would really appreciate this. Thank you for all the support we have been giving to help Lilly with her condition. Teddies, love, advice and a virtual hug when needed. We know these times are hard but just seeing and hearing the love has gotten us all through.  </span></p>",Kier Group and the British Heart Foundation partnership,8.75,0,115,115,0,kirsty,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,80c02fc8-3b4b-4f1d-9ab8-8ecaea64bd8c,NA,NA,NA,My birthday  's Birthday,https://www.justgiving.com/Kirsty-Greig3,/Kirsty-Greig3,United Kingdom,...Kier Group and the <strong>British</strong> <strong>Heart</strong> <strong>Foundation</strong> partnership...,Kier Group and the British Heart Foundation partnership,//images.justgiving.com/image/8aeb98aa-590d-446f-b664-2d9662b8cd06.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,67.65442,kirsty greig,2021-03-07T08:39:28,183092,6566967,2021-03-14T00:00:00,100,641389,59935736-0814-485e-a4de-4014bd5a3262,donating for CHD for my birthday than gifts,for our brave Lilly and everyone else with a CHD,British Heart Foundation,183092,225971,183092,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-03-12T07:08:21Z

November. She was our bundle of joy, our light our life. Sadly we were hit, just 6 weeks later, with the news that Lauryn had a heart defect. It was later diagnosed as being dilated cardiomyopathy. We were told that because of the severity of her heart, she may need a transplant by the time she was two. We were broken..but carried on for our gorgeous bubbly girl. The next couple of years were spent in numerous hospitals...including Great Ormond Street and Glenfield Hospitals. It was a long, hard journey but we got through it, mainly due to Lauryn's resilience, strength and will to succeed. But we would have been lost without the amazing support we got from all hospitals and the staff involved in Lauryn's care. I would like make a special mention to Dr. Bu'lock at Glenfield Hospital, nothing was ever too much trouble for this amazing lady. We were eventually sent home with a truck load of medicines, pumps and other medical kit,  and of course our princess, to get on with our lives...it was scary at first but we got through it. With the odd admissions and medication tweak  in between, Lauryn lived a near to complete life for the next 16 years. In February 2019, 3 months after her 18th birthday,  Lauryn suddenly took ill. After a few hospital checks, we were told she needed a heart transplant. We were both shocked and devastated, when we were told. Lauryn was finally admitted to Papworth Hospital and had her heart transplant on the 26th. April 2019. Once again, the staff at both City and Papworth hospitals were amazing, ensuring that Lauryn got the best care. Lauryn was also amazing, she was strong, brave and determined, a true fighter throughout this journey, we were so proud of our beautiful girl...so proud. Her transplant was successful and La was discharged on 17th May 2019. I am hurting so badly as I write this, as apart from 1 minor blip, Lauryn remained healthy.  After her transplant we hoped and prayed that Lauryn would lead a full and happy life and she was..she was enjoying life again! Sadly Lauryn passed away suddenly on 7th. February 2020.  Our  heart's have been ripped out..there is now a huge void in our lives.. Lauryn fought admirably through every stage of her wonderful life...only for it to be taken away so abruptly. Our angel Lauryn - we will always love you.. you will always be with us - you will always inspire us.

Your small steps will help Guide Dogs make giant leaps. Just one week of stepping can make a difference to the life of children and adults living with sight loss. Raise over £50 (£25 for children) and well replace those worn out socks with a brand-new Guide Dogs pair designed by an international fashion icon!

How your funds will change lives...

-	£50 could pay for fun, tactile activities to help children co-ordinate their muscles and movements.

-	£96 could pay for an eye test each for two guide dogs in training

-	£116 could buy a Training School Kit for one of our guide dog trainers who will teach pups the specialist skills they need as fully qualified guide dogs.

-	£710 could buy a Birthing Kit containing all the essential equipment for a guide dog mum to safely deliver her puppies.

Its thanks to people like you that we can continue to provide life-changing services. So, a huge thank you and lots of luck for your challenge!

She passed peacefully in April 2020 with her loving family by her side. </span></p><p>There is nothing I can do now, apart from try and raise awareness and support to cancer research rather than my birthday, so then hopefully the future lives of others can be supported and essentially treated.

March is the start of Marie Curies well known and supported Great Daffodil Appeal, this year because they aren’t able to fundraise in the normal way, they have asked people to take on different challenges to help raise vital funds. We want to take on them ALL. During March we will be Stepping into Spring with 10,000 steps a day, challenging ourselves to 3000 squats, taking on a two hour fitness challenge and we will also be sharing kindness to our friends family and neighbours by delivering daffodils and window display cards to those people who would like to support Marie Curie from the comfort of their own home.  If you would like to receive a daffodil and a window card please just send us a message and we would love to come and deliver one to you either personally or by post. It doesn’t matter how big or small the donation may be as every penny really does count. The charity provided over 66,000 hours of direct nursing care last year,to people living with a terminal illness in the North East and we would like to do something to help such a worthy cause. Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure. Your details are safe with JustGiving - they'll never sell them on or send unwanted emails. Once you donate, they'll send your money directly to the charity. So it's the most efficient way to donate - saving time and cutting costs for the charity.</p>","Archie and Milo step up, squat down and share kindness for Marie Curie",37.50,0,150,75,0,NA,true,true,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Archie and Milo step up, squat down and share kindness for Marie Curie",https://www.justgiving.com/ArchieMilo1,/ArchieMilo1,United Kingdom,...<strong>Curie</strong>...,"Archie and Milo step up, squat down and share kindness for Marie Curie",//images.justgiving.com/image/39d80f71-6d18-47a2-a033-a30459e4c740.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,22.767696,Victoria Wilkinson-Rhea,2021-03-04T09:36:04,50,6561297,2021-03-01T00:00:00,200,12130,5d50452f-63e2-4926-83f7-1e837dbc0b56,NA,NA,Marie Curie,50,207994,50,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-03-12T07:08:21Z

He was so fit, healthy and active. This came out of nowhere and smashed our world into pieces.</p><p>He was diagnosed and then died 3 weeks later.<span> He was ever so brave and dignified after receiving such news. I was in awe of him even more than ever. </span><span>Having to process that my Dad who was my everything was going to die imminently and then watch this happen is indescribable, but how he took this news on the chin was just incredible. The first thing he did after being told this news was worry about us and how we were. That's who he was, an incredibly special, caring man.</span><span> </span></p><p><span>For anyone who knew my Dad they knew he was someone who would help out anyone and put everyone before himself. </span></p><p>The the only help left for Dad and us were the amazing and invaluable Marie Curie nurses. <br/>Marie Curie nurses brought some wonderful brightness back into our darkest moments while my Dad was dying and the care they provided him was 2nd to none during some of the most unprecedented times we have all recently experienced and I know they are doing this daily for so many others who have a terminal illness. <br/>They really are Earths angels.&#128519;<br/>They are so important and I know you don't ever think of these organisations until you need them and that's totally understandable. I was one of these people. <br/>This is why I'm showing my support for them now with their Great Daffodil Appeal which had been very different this year due to current restrictions. <br/><br/>I'm currently trying to raise awareness for them as they are in desperate need like alot of other charities at the moment and this one is obviously close to my heart. <br/>Marie Curie offer so much support to people with terminal illness. Care at home, hospice care, bereavement councilling it's endless.</p><p>I have a few boxes of beautiful daffodils pin badges(35 in a box) which have been provided to me by Marie Curie. Obviously at present, times are very different and restricted. I<span> have created this page so anyone who would like a daffodil but cannot get one physically can purchase a virtual one by making a small donation to show support even if they are unable to obtain a daffodil pin badge. If anyone would like to give a donation for a virtual Daffodil pin badge then the suggested amount is £1. For every box of daffodil pin badges sold it will provide</span><span> just over an hours care for someone with a terminal illness. </span></p><p>Please contact me or Mike if you would like a daffodil pin badge physically, as delivery may be possible in the local area. </p><p>There have been alot people like me who have lost people they love so dearly, especially in 2020/21 and its been very hard and different for everyone who has during this time but without organisations like Marie Curie, times would be a lot, lot harder. </p><p>Thankyou for taking the time to read this and thanks for your support. </p><p>Annie :) xx</p><p><br/></p>",Roger's memory,117.50,0,685,685,0,Roger Cooke,NA,NA,850371,Roger Cooke,/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/13882871,remember/850371,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,In memory of Roger Cooke,https://www.justgiving.com/Annie-Cooke85,/Annie-Cooke85,United Kingdom,,Roger's memory,//images.justgiving.com/image/f1102ae1-8cc7-4ddf-bb2e-e334d5161d38.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,20.435532,Annie Cooke ,2021-03-10T09:35:52,50,6572568,2021-03-10T09:35:52,100,12130,98e99747-2a4e-4f79-8a7e-abc98977d140,Raising money for the Great Daffodil Appeal,they helped care for my Dad in his hours of need.,Marie Curie,50,207994,50,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-03-12T07:08:21Z

We plan on hosting a football match between ourselves to be played between August – September dependant on the ruling from the government over the summer break. As the pandemic got the better of us playing the match last year, we decided to restart and plan for this year as the restrictions would be reduced. We would like to support two charities that are close to our hearts that both got to extraordinary measures to make a difference to people’s lives. We chose Marie Curie and Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM), as the two charities which all the fund we raise will go to.</span></p><p><span>Marie Curie are a charity organisation that offer care and support through terminal illness. Marie Curie Nurses and frontline staff are needed more than ever to provide vital care, expertise and compassion to dying people and their families, in their homes and our hospices across the UK, especially due to the current pandemic. They rely on the generosity of the public to deliver care. They face a devastating loss of funds. Volunteers are unable to collect on the streets, fundraising events and community activities have been cancelled or postponed and charity shops are having to close. Personally, this has affected me through the loss of my grandad last year during the pandemic. Being told he had oesophagus cancer that was terminal and being given a period of time to live was like a hole to the heart. Without the help of the palliative care team, the time would have been increasingly more difficult and much more painful. If it wasn’t for the generosity, of the public giving and the nurses staying the night, it may have become unbearable. Through donations, you could provide hours of nursing support, an evening's care or even comfort someone who is living with a terminal illness.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, CALM is a leading movement against suicide and mental health. Every week 125 people in the UK take their own lives and 75% of all UK suicides are male. CALM exists to change this. They run this movement in three different ways: Frontline Services, Communities and Campaigns. This is all free and confidential, 7 hours a day, 7 hours a week, for anybody who needs to talk about their life problems, whether being their own or someone else’s that they are concerned about. By spreading the message, we feel it will help more people get the help or advice that they need, from whatever aspect. There's no need to hide or feel embarrassed about any life issue and through this it would help anybody out there. Through a personal experience, I know the feeling of what happens after suicide and that it shouldn’t be taken as a joke or something to be kept quiet. It takes away someone and rips a family apart, as they always hold a strong part in someone’s life. To see how staggering the figure is every week, is heart-breaking, and we feel that there are ways in which this could be reduced and eased through any difficult time especially in the current climate of the pandemic.</span></p><p><span>On behalf of Chris and Alec, we would like to raise awareness for both charities and movements. Please donate as much or as little as you can, as both of these charities have made a personal impact on us on our own troubling times.

As well as being a place where people can stay to get the expert care they need in a friendly and homely setting, we also support people visiting with clinics and therapies. These include yoga, exercise classes and relaxation. People using the day unit can also get together over a freshly cooked lunch from our chefs.

Relatives and friends can visit any time of the day or night, and stay with their loved ones if they wish to.

While I walk I will be appreciating the change of seasons and the great work they do in our local area and hoping to reach a goal of GBP500 for the charity.</p><p>Thank You for your support and happy Spring to you all.</p>",Tony's 100 Mile Walk in March,68.75,0,305,61,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,100 Mile Walk in March,https://www.justgiving.com/TonyWarren100mile,/TonyWarren100mile,United Kingdom,,Tony's 100 Mile Walk in March,//images.justgiving.com/image/b7f55f8b-df38-4763-952b-bf980b276d32.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,16.131233,Tony Warren,2021-03-04T18:42:22,50,6562500,2021-03-01T00:00:00,500,12130,805603f4-2efd-4b70-af95-298280c4a6dd,I am walking 100 miles in March for Marie Curie,of the great work they do in Cornwall,Marie Curie,50,207994,50,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-03-12T07:08:21Z

These include yoga, exercise classes and relaxation. People using the day unit can also get together over a freshly cooked lunch from our chefs.

Relatives and friends can visit any time of the day or night, and stay with their loved ones if they wish to. 

We need to raise £6,397 per day to run the hospice, so every penny counts. Thank you for helping to make sure more people with a terminal illness in in Liverpool, get the care and support they need.

The new Shannon Class Lifeboat arrived on station on 18 October 2020, and became operational on 31 Dec 2020, is the 14th lifeboat to be stationed at Seahouses, formerly known as North Sunderland. The Station provides rescue cover from Dunstanburgh Castle in the south, to Holy Island to the north, and includes the ever-popular Farne Islands. They are visited by thousands of people a year, aboard passenger boats operating from Seahouses. The area is very popular with visitors, for the wildlife, heritage, and the vast expanse of beaches. The station crew often assist with leisure related callouts, including assisting swimmers, body and kite boarders, yachts, diver related incidents and pleasure craft. People and vehicles cut off by the tide on Holy Island Causeway are another frequent call for the station.

In addition to this, Gracie's Uncle had a fond passion for the Lifeboats and model boat building, a hobby also enjoyed by her late Grandad Bill, and memories of her late Grandad Seaside (clue is in the name) who swam in the sea every day from April to October until the end of his life in his 90s. </p><p><span>Fortunately, none of us have ever required the services of the RNLI, but too many people are still drowning. More than ever we need the RNLI’s help. As a charity, the RNLI depends on our donations so it can go on saving lives and keeping us and our loved ones safe. RNLI lifesavers are our lifeline. They’re the lifeboat crews who provide 24-hour search and rescue right around the UK and Ireland. The lifeguards keeping watch on 240 of the busiest beaches in the UK and Channel Islands.

Our volunteer crews rely on the safest, most reliable lifeboats and modern stations to launch from. Scotlands unrivalled coasts and waters are valued by local communities and visitors alike, with millions travelling to enjoy them, and work on them each year. But the water remains an unpredictable environment that can catch people out. People will always need our help and we will always be there to answer that call.Keeping a modern fleet of lifeboats maintained, fuelled and ever ready to go to the rescue from all 46 of the lifeboat stations in Scotland is expensive and we rely entirely on voluntary donations to ensure this service is maintained. It costs an average of £155k to run a lifeboat station in Scotland but with the implications of Covid-19, we havent been able to fundraise as normal to help keep our lifeboats afloat.

A healthy marine habitat helps sustain good oxygen levels, fights global warming and preserves endangered species and plant life, coral reefs etc. The WWF works in collaboration with fisheries, governments and other organisations around the world to prevent overfishing, and finding various solutions to maintain marine life, for example by creating pockets of safe zones where fishing is illegal (in these safe zones marine life can thrive). </span><br/><br/></p><p><i>'WWF is at the heart of global efforts to address the world’s most important environmental challenges: safeguarding the natural world, tackling climate change and enabling people to use only their fair share of natural resources.

5,777 miles might take us a while to complete, so we are going to compete in two teams and start at each end - one team in Manchester and one team in Madagascar - and the objective is to meet in the middle by Easter, and see who gets there first!

Well be walking, running, cycling, rowing or even swimming (when allowed!) to help contribute individually and virtually to the 5,777 miles we need to complete together.

I can’t quite believe it but I will be retiring in the next few weeks -  though where have the last 48 years gone? The 13th August 1973, when I first started work it seems only like yesterday but I’ve certainly had a bit of fun since I started in a garage as an Apprentice Panel Beater all those years ago.

I realised fairly quickly that repairing dented cars wasn’t going to be the greatest career and so joined Local Government as a Trainee Civil Engineer in 1975 which eventually lead me to joining STW in 2000.

And so at Severn Trent after about 13 different managers, 9 different jobs, 4 different bases and whole load of laughs (and really passionate moans) it’s time to improve my golf handicap and do some charity work in the local area.

However, after 48 years I have acquired some real quality tat, which I have been advised by Mrs Bywater “won’t be filling up the garage at home” and so for a bit of fun and to mark my retirement I’d like to offer you the chance to take part in a raffle for some of this quality stuff.

The proceeds of the Raffle will be equally distributed to three very special charities that are very close to my heart, Prostate Cancer UK, Crohns & Colitis UK and WaterAid. Everyone who contributes will receive a prize, it might be a whole (part used, of course) pack of “post-its” or depending on the number raffle participants a single post-it but everyone will receive something!

I know it sounds presumptive but, honestly, I would prefer that anyone who thought they may want to contribute to some B&Q vouchers for my leaving present, would be better off contributing to this raffle and helping to make a difference to the 3 great charities. The chance of winning some outstanding junk as well is an opportunity too good to be missed.  I mean, who doesn’t want a second-hand pair of wellies, blunt scissors or a hole punch?

I have a very close family member who suffers from Crohns Disease.  It is a desperately debilitating illness that is not outwardly obvious but causes considerable pain, discomfort and fatigue. Currently there is no cure, only a cocktail of drugs with many horrible side effects, but still result in frequent hospital visits and operations for long bearing sufferers. Crohns and Colitis UK, like many charities, struggle for funding but still do a brilliant job in supporting those affected and carer families, and importantly funding research. I’m hopeful and confident that a cure will found soon to help those who suffer from this little known, but in fact quite common illness.

As some of you may be aware, I was diagnosed with Prostate Cancer in 2016, resulting in a Prostatectomy in early 2017. It’s a cancer that plagues the Bywater family, and was the primary cancer that eventually caused my father to pass away.  My two brothers are both affected, and I know many uncles and cousins are similarly affected or have died as a result of this disease. However, this great charity has raised  awareness and encouraged men to be tested to spot early signs, and so 4 years later I have the all clear and my brothers are in good places too. I had no signs of illness but following my dad’s death in 1997, my brothers and I made a pact to be tested regularly and it was this monitoring that has spotted our early signs of trouble ahead. Therefore please guys, don’t be proud or macho, get tested (it’s only a simple PFA blood test) and it might save your life!  This equally applies to women too, Breast Cancer is the female equivalent of Prostate Cancer and so you too should take testing and monitoring seriously, it may save your life too.

The last, but not least, charity is WaterAid. Clean water and good sanitation is something we all take for granted (even though this is what we do for a living) and never really think about as we see it a basic human right, but for many in the world it is not available on demand but a daily chore to fetch and carry filthy disease ridden water for cooking and drinking. You only need to look at the great articles that WaterAid produce to see how a simple tap in a village can make such a huge difference to people’s lives.  In 2019, I had the greatest pleasure in working  for WaterAid at Glastonbury Festival and have to say it was one of the best working weeks of my life.  I  hadn’t realised how cleaning loos for Festival goers could be so rewarding  but knowing that all the money raised at this brilliant festival goes to just four  charities was the icing on a fantastic cake.

Therefore, thank you to everyone I have met, worked, agreed, disagreed, annoyed, debated, cajoled or just had a laugh with, I had a great time. Please buy a raffle ticket and obtain some quality rubbish that you can put in the skip, because I couldn’t, just in case I might need it one day!</p>",Brian’s page,0,0,0,0,0,NA,true,true,NA,NA,NA,NA,467f2991-de39-4aad-bce8-c00e68ac0132,Brian-Bywater-Charity-Raffle,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Brian Bywater Charity Raffle,https://www.justgiving.com/brian-bywater-charity-raffle,/brian-bywater-charity-raffle,United Kingdom,,Brian’s page,//images.justgiving.com/image/9408a6ee-93a3-4ac8-88d1-efb88e98f3a9.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,17.991545,Brian Bywater,2021-03-05T15:46:29,54697,6562605,2021-03-05T12:00:00,0,56780,97b6ca2d-19ab-4101-b5df-d9e382f49ed5,NA,NA,WaterAid,54697,288701,54697,Global poverty,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2021-03-12T07:08:21Z

Clean water is important to us, we understand that it can be life saving which is why we've decided to raise money for Water Aid by walking part of the Antarctic coastline! 

The pipe system of our clinical washbasin unit was designed after inspiration of the feet of the penguin, how they could keep warm in the freezing temperatures of the South Pole which is why we chose the Antarctic.

Angel Guard's clinical washbasin units have one main aim – to save millions of lives across the world whilst saving hospitals millions of pounds at the same time. Each year in the UK hundreds of thousands of people become infected in hospitals from the water supplied by taps and showers. Angel Guard prevents this through its unique design (including 100% touch free delivery of water and soap and anti-splash washbasin), materials of construction and use of technology. Each unit contains a variety of different precision sensors monitoring many parameters 24/7 - including flow, hot and cold incoming temperatures, current temperatures and temperature changes in-between flow events. In addition, units have up to 3 bacteria sensors positioned in critical areas such as the hot and cold-water pipes and the tap outlet. Other areas monitored include number of uses, when the unit was last cleaned, has unauthorised liquid been poured down the basin. Each unit then takes the data and risk assesses itself 24/7 based upon the above data and assigns a risk level. If required, a countermeasure will then be deployed including thermal or chemical disinfection. All actions and data are then stored for future reference.</p>",Alastairs page,0,0,20,20,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0c368f26-153b-46d9-b693-dbe98acca918,angel-guard,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Angel guard walks the Antarctic coast,https://www.justgiving.com/Alastairspage,/Alastairspage,United Kingdom,,Alastairs page,//images.justgiving.com/image/4f545c05-4b13-4359-9c5c-f154df0806cd.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,14.997835,Alastair Queen,2021-03-04T00:13:28,54697,6560300,2021-03-04T12:00:00,100,56780,f602ec2b-7a23-4a83-abb5-b726ec2e1786,I am walking,everybody deserves safe water.,WaterAid,54697,288701,54697,Global poverty,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2021-03-12T07:08:21Z

They have a lack of basic healthcare, severe food shortages and limited clean water.  

CARE is focused on helping the most vulnerable people, through distributing food to families in need, and cash vouchers so that families can purchase for themselves the food they need.

Over a year of fighting and fuel shortages has destroyed water pipes and water pumping facilities, so CARE is rehabilitating water sources and providing water tanks so women and children can get safe drinking water without having to travel long distances.

CARE is also providing hygiene kits, paying special attention to womens and children's needs.

They have a lack of basic healthcare, severe food shortages and limited clean water.  

CARE is focused on helping the most vulnerable people, through distributing food to families in need, and cash vouchers so that families can purchase for themselves the food they need.

Over a year of fighting and fuel shortages has destroyed water pipes and water pumping facilities, so CARE is rehabilitating water sources and providing water tanks so women and children can get safe drinking water without having to travel long distances.

CARE is also providing hygiene kits, paying special attention to womens and children's needs.
