Cancer is a horrible disease, it has taken many of my loved ones, my friends loved ones and many others. We all need to pull together and beat this once and for all.

No one should face cancer alone. Let's put up a fight and give back to such a wonderful charity that work so hard to help our loved ones.

I'll be running 31 miles throughout the month to raise money for Great Ormond Street Children's hospital, a charity very close to our hearts<span> (GOSH Charity) . </span></p><p><span>In October 2017, just 7 weeks after our middle son Freddie was born we was about to start a journey we never imagined. 48 hours after being admitted into hospital by an ambulance, a lumbar puncture, IV antibiotics and an oxygen machine, we was told ‘the next 24 hours were critical’ after not responding to antibiotics. I couldn’t imagine leaving the  hospital without my 7 week old baby boy, it was the worst time of my life. BUT 5 days later Freddie came home. </span></p><p><span>Still unaware of his condition we was being told it was just bronchiolitis and would stop come the spring, April 2018 came and we lost count the times we was blue lighted into A&amp;E back on oxygen and antibiotics. A mother’s instinct that something just wasn’t quite right so we got referred to Great Ormond Street hospital where we met the most amazing doctors and nurses who I will forever be grateful to. One consultant knew almost instantly what was going on with Freddie and after numerous tests it was confirmed Freddie had a condition called laryngeal cleft, a rare condition that will occur 1 in 20,000 births and usually happens at week 6 of pregnancy. </span></p><p><span>On our journey at Great Ormond Street hospital I met another mum of a little boy who was 5 months old. After sharing stories of why we was there she told me her son was diagnosed with a rare blood cancer at 3 months old and was having treatment to just prolong his life, his condition was terminal. What was worse she had lost her 5 year old daughter to a heart condition the year before, just utterly heartbreaking and a lady I will never forget. What mum deserves to loose both of her children before school age!  </span></p><p><span>After an operation and a few hospital stays Freddie was ‘fixed’. We still have annual hospital checks to make sure his lungs are doing ok but he was definitely one of the lucky ones. Some children will never leave that hospital or even get to have a Christmas/birthday in their own home with their family and this is where the charity for Great Ormond Street comes in. The NHS fund the hospital with the treatments provided to the patients but making the hospital a home for hundreds of children who will never leave or get to have a Christmas/birthday at home is where they need our help with donations. They have special day staff which play with the children, supply toys whilst the sick children can’t leave, craft afternoons and much much more but without donations this wouldn’t be possible, which is why I will be running 31 miles in January to help raise money. </span></p><p><br/></p>",Katie's running for GOSH ,5,0,30,30,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,73d345e9-c72b-4dff-b0f6-ebe17ca58037,NA,Running off Christmas 2021,https://www.justgiving.com/katies-running-for-gosh,/katies-running-for-gosh,uk,,Katie's running for GOSH ,//images.justgiving.com/image/7876a377-ea09-4651-b390-3919997bb240.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,16.451233,katie Ede,31,Fitness goal,2020-12-17T19:01:49,254,6270851,2021-01-01T00:00:00,100,12057,928ba31c-00f4-498d-8693-7e4bbd62e2b2,Great Ormond Street Hospital,254,1160024,254,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2020-12-18T06:16:57Z
