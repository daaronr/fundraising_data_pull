The funeral took place at Chichester Crematorium on Friday 16th October and with the current Covid restrictions we were unable to celebrate her life as we would have wished.</p><p>Joan was the youngest of two sisters, born in Ely and growing up in Soham in Cambridgeshire. In 1942, at the age of 16, she contracted Diphtheria and was admitted to the Isolation Hospital at Exning with her Mother, Violet; her sister, Phyllis, soon joined them. Her Mother died in the June and Joan and Phyllis had to remain in hospital for another month and were unable to attend the funeral.</p><p>Joan married in 1952 and William and I were welcomed soon afterwards. In 1958 the family moved to Selsey. Phyllis remained in Soham until 2006, when she surprised us by marrying for the first time at the age of 83 and moving to Selsey. Phyllis had always suffered from poor eyesight and was registered blind. When her husband died in 2010 Phyllis went to live with Joan and they looked after each other until Phyllis died in October 2013. </p><p>Joan and Phyllis' cousin Joyce also suffers from macular degeneration and is registered blind; all three of them supported<b> 'Sightsavers' </b>as they realised how vulnerable they all felt with failing eyesight and wanted to help prevent avoidable sight-loss for others.</p><p>William and I requested that there were no flowers at the funeral - Janet made a coffin spray from Mother's garden - but donations in Joan's memory may be made via Dillistone and Wraight in Chichester or via JustGiving.</p><p><span>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure. Your details are safe with JustGiving - they'll never sell them on or send unwanted emails. Once you donate, they'll send your money directly to the charity. So it's the most efficient way to donate - saving time and cutting costs for the charity.</span><br/></p>",NA,NA,In loving memory of Joan Pledger (nee Gibson) 21st May 1926 - 11th  October 2020.,0,0,0,0,0,NA,https://images.justgiving.com/image/e19236e7-5d4b-4b93-b2aa-e656635530a1.jpg,https://images.justgiving.com/image/e19236e7-5d4b-4b93-b2aa-e656635530a1.jpg?template=size150x150face,true,true,Joan Pledger,814312,Joan Pledger ,/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/13414212,remember/814312,NA,In memory of Joan Pledger,https://www.justgiving.com/Richard-Pledger1,/Richard-Pledger1,United Kingdom,,In loving memory of Joan Pledger (nee Gibson) 21st May 1926 - 11th  October 2020.,//images.justgiving.com/image/96aa12a7-1d35-4c75-9ed0-00d8764d5b6c.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,27.635796,Richard Pledger,2020-10-15T06:25:31,179,6280869,2020-10-15T06:25:30,100,12271,e0a1e13b-bc7b-4d02-bc62-a742d5ea627c,NA,NA,Sightsavers,179,207544,179,Global poverty,1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2020-10-16T05:11:45Z
