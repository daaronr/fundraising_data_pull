From 15th February, well be walking, running, cycling, rowing and swimming to travel the 5,777 miles between Manchester to Madagascar, all in aid of highlighting WaterAid's work in Antenanarivo, Madagascar.

5,777 miles might take us a while to complete, so we are going to compete in two teams and start at each end - one team in Manchester and one team in Madagascar - and the objective is to meet in the middle by Easter, and see who gets there first!

Well be walking, running, cycling, rowing or even swimming (when allowed!) to help contribute individually and virtually to the 5,777 miles we need to complete together. 

The objective is to improve all our wellbeing, get us all out more in the fresh air and away from our computers, and to raise £5,777 for a truly magnificent cause!
