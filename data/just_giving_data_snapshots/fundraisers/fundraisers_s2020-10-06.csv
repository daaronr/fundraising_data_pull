They have a lack of basic healthcare, severe food shortages and limited clean water.  

CARE is focused on helping the most vulnerable people, through distributing food to families in need, and cash vouchers so that families can purchase for themselves the food they need.

Over a year of fighting and fuel shortages has destroyed water pipes and water pumping facilities, so CARE is rehabilitating water sources and providing water tanks so women and children can get safe drinking water without having to travel long distances.

CARE is also providing hygiene kits, paying special attention to womens and children's needs.
