When we first discovered the news, we had no idea who talk to or what the next steps were. We were at a standstill. We turned to Macmillan and not only did they support our dad but the whole family. To give back to Macmillan, and other families coping with cancer, we are each doing a 30-day 30 mile run in hopes to raise as much money and awareness as we can. <br/><br/>Our dad didn’t show any symptoms of cancer.

Some of us have changed career, we are all living in different parts of the UK and our friendships have struggled at times but we are still now and always will be connected with love, mutual appreciation and fond memories. We don't get to see eachother as often as we would like but we are coming together now to try and raise as much money as possible for an amazing, worthy cause.

Last year Ellie's step-dad (Joe) whom we have set up this page in memory of, died from cancer. Joe was diagnosed very abruptly and once they knew that he had cancer the disease quickly took over and Joe did not get very long to live. It was extremely hard for the family especially with the type of year it was in 2020 (Covid-19) but Marie Curie were there to help them through their darkest days. 

L

Last month Ellie managed to raise an amazing £800 for the charity and so we have decided to join her in her quest to raise even more money in Joe's memory. Any money that you can give would be amazing and we will all appreciate it so much! We all have different running abilities and experience but hope that together we can reach our target of 200 miles. It will be tough but with your donations to keep us motivated and our supportive friendships we are hoping we can pull this off. 

Thank you to everyone who takes the time to visit our page and donate.</p>",Faye’s page,0,0,0,0,0,true,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,83d45294-f7d1-4e7a-8eb0-abf3125c816d,NA,4-friends-200-miles,Running for Joe,https://www.justgiving.com/justgivine,/justgivine,,,Faye’s page,//images.justgiving.com/image/fa3079d3-6ad4-4a38-9645-b8f482b5d36a.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,21.39508,Faye T,2021-01-02T17:48:19,50,6438977,2021-01-02T17:45:19,100,12130,e5054e5b-f418-4932-8b35-75e39557d94c,NA,NA,Marie Curie,50,207994,50,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-01-03T06:22:15Z
