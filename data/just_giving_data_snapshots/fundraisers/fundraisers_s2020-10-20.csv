By no means does it look like a hospital, but just a normal hotel room. They took care of my Nan and granddad so well, and met all her needs.

Despite our age difference, she was a consistent and loving presence in my life. Most of my fondest childhood memories, and many of my adult ones, feature Kathy. Her kindness to me, especially at times when everything else felt a bit uncertain, her willingness to laugh, and her love for her family are examples to us all. This love grew to encompass Coree (who she, from a sense of compassion, and perhaps sisterly-nosiness, invited to join us for a Christmas Eve celebration very early on in our relationship. Luckily Coree received the seal of approval) and later Teddy. Our last visit included a trip to the outdoor centre near Kathy’s home. Teddy was enamoured with the ride-on construction vehicles and Kathy joined him in his fun. When Coree and I tried to chivvy him along to see the other exhibits, she turned to us and said ‘He’s having so much fun, let him play!’ She was determined, despite treatments which often left her poorly, to squeeze every last bit of pleasure out of life and encouraged us to do the same.</p><p><br/></p><p>Mourning her passing, and celebrating her life, was made more difficult due to the pandemic and I’ve struggled since to figure out how best to commemorate her life.
