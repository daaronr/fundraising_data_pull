Through completing various challenges on Strava to complete 5ks or 10ks within a month, or even walk a total of over 50km within a month, we started to look for bigger challenges for 2021. And then we found the perfect one through EndtoEnd.run: The Land’s End to John O’Groats virtual run/walk – totalling 874 miles.



To achieve this we have to walk/run at least 2.4 miles on average every single day of the year! This may not sound like a lot…but it means not too many off days, and no injuries!



The chosen charity of our employer, Nufarm UK Ltd, is Macmillan Cancer Support – so we have decided to try and raise some funds for them while counting up the miles. Like many people, both of us have had family and friends who have had cancer, and are aware of and have experienced the amazing work done by Macmillan. 



Anyone that is on Strava and connected with either or both of us will be able to see our progress – as that is our proof of walks and runs!



Our aim is to try and reach £500 – thanks to anyone that would like to donate anything at all through this page! Remember no donation is too small, and please do the Gift Aid if you are able!</p>",Marks page,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,51ebbc77-f3b0-4b0a-ba9a-027cd7713bac,nick-and-mark,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Lands End to John O'Groats Virtual Walk/Run,https://www.justgiving.com/Nick-Mark,/Nick-Mark,United Kingdom,,Marks page,//images.justgiving.com/image/f3b9856c-ed53-4e4c-96b1-609a549db75f.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,15.878002,Mark Sykes,NA,NA,2021-01-27T16:44:01,2116,6485403,2021-01-27T16:39:27,0,13507,e6bd701f-1f0d-4032-b04a-e1cc80e98432,Macmillan Cancer Support,2116,261017,2116,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-01-28T07:02:15Z

We work for Which? and we are fundraising for the British Heart Foundation in memory of our friend and colleague Sarah Price, who passed away suddenly last year at the age of 39. 

Sarah was a wonderful person; she excelled in her job but was also a committed team-player, going to great lengths to help her team members day-in, day-out. She was a brilliant friend: funny and kind, someone who always made time for everyone she encountered.

We continue to miss her greatly. 

Sarah was a big fan of Welsh rugby and so we are planning to run, walk or cycle a combined distance that will stretch from our Bristol office, where Sarah worked, to the Principality Stadium in Cardiff and back again, which is around 86 miles in total. We plan to do this over the weekend of 27 - 28 February 2021, being the weekend closest to both St. David's Day and Sarah's 5-year anniversary since she started at Which?.

Each participant will undertake 5km, either walking, running or cycling, to help us get to the total distance. 

The BHF has helped halve the number of people dying from heart and circulatory disease in the UK but sadly every day hundreds of people lose their lives. It's only thanks to donations that the BHF can create new treatments and discover new cures. £24 could pay for two hours of research by an early career scientist, but every pound helps so please give what you can to help us hit our target.

We work for Which? and we are fundraising for the British Heart Foundation in memory of our friend and colleague Sarah Price, who passed away suddenly last year at the age of 39. 

Sarah was a wonderful person; she excelled in her job but was also a committed team-player, going to great lengths to help her team members day-in, day-out. She was a brilliant friend: funny and kind, someone who always made time for everyone she encountered.

We continue to miss her greatly. 

Sarah was a big fan of Welsh rugby and so we are planning to run, walk or cycle a combined distance that will stretch from our Bristol office, where Sarah worked, to the Principality Stadium in Cardiff and back again, which is around 86 miles in total.

I'm raising money for the British Heart Foundation and I'd be so grateful for your support. The BHF has helped halve the number of people dying from heart and circulatory disease in the UK but sadly every day hundreds of people lose their lives. It's only thanks to support from people like us that the BHF can create new treatments and discover new cures. £24 could pay for two hours of research by an early career scientist, but every pound helps so please give what you can to help me hit my target. I thought I was going to lose my husband the day he became ill and the hospital struggled to get his heart rate regulated. Sitting in A&amp; E on your own while Doctors try and keep your husband alive is very scary. They discovered he had Atrial Fibrillation but after a couple of operations and medication he is now doing OK.

She was born with ventricular septal defect commonly known as a hole in the heart. Along with other complications such as pulmonary atresia,  Lauren has faced many risky and life threatening surgery’s. One in which she will undertake in a matter of weeks. Imagine facing open heart surgery during a pandemic! It feels particularly difficult as we, along with many other family’s facing such surgery’s cannot physically support our loved ones. It will be a months before I can see her and give her a cuddle. &#128148; now that is heart breaking! </p><p>The man entrusted in keeping Lauren’s heart safe during this surgery is professor massimo Caputo. With the financial support from the British heart foundation, he has been able to change the lives of not only Lauren but babies and children born with congenital heart disease. His on going research and dedication to his work is improving the way small babies and children and operated on with higher success rates and long term prognosis improving.</p><p>So all I have to do it give up sweets, chocolate and fizzy drinks for a month.....that’s it &#129335;&#127996;&#8205;♀️ Hoping that some of you will make a donation to the British heart foundation through me.  Compared to what Lauren and many others will be facing this year my half of the deal doesn’t seem so bad. What’s a Mars bar or a can of coke....it’s a chance....or a new valve.....it’s a heartbeat....it’s a life   ❤️ </p><p>Please help me help those who are mending and preventing broken hearts ❤️ Thank you &#128522; </p><p>&#128149;I dedicate this fundraiser to Lauren, who I can’t see and be with right now, but know we are cheering you on from a distance. You have faced your surgery’s with such courage and strength and this time will be the same. We are all so proud and send so much love and strength to you. Until we are together again (hopefully very soon) lots of love &#128149; </p><p>“Be strong, be fearless, be beautiful.

Over two million people have been bereaved since the UK lockdown began, whether as a result of coronavirus or another cause.  We need a time together to reflect on our collective sense of loss, and to remember and celebrate the lives of the people who’ve died, as we begin to heal from the trauma of this national crisis. The day&#8239;to&#8239;reflect, grieve and remember will coincide with the one-year anniversary of lockdown.</p><p>We really hope that you will join us to mark these special occasions.

This means that people have been cared for at home in line with their wishes, and also that family members have had the chance to get some much needed rest. It costs £20 an hour for a Marie Curie Nurse to care for someone at home, and I'm raising £360 to pay for 2 nights of care for patients and families who desperately need it. I'm so grateful for every donation, no matter how small.

With your support, Oxfam can continue its life-saving work, it can continue to put together packages of food, give farming support, set up foodbanks, support education for women and girls, and provide cash to buy essentials.

For each £15 we raise, we could help more women to understand their rights, challenge discrimination and to take up leadership roles within their local communities.

For each £35, we could help families access emergency food supplies. 

£45 could provide one of our new handwashing stations to enable frequent handwashing and disease prevention.
