Understanding treatments and impact and how to support Mike to make a decision what's best for him. Then frustration and worry as COVID hits the world and treatment is delayed. I begun to unravel, putting on a brave face for Mike and our sons, Max and Alex. Must stay strong, not give up, breaking is not an option. I knew I needed to speak to someone and cry, scream, talk, vent. I reached out to Macmillan, who put me in contact with the most amazing counsellor. I am so grateful for her support. She listened and asked questions, sometimes hard ones and helped me deal with the emotional roller coaster. She helped me understand that it is ok to not be ok, which was a profound discovery for me. Because of lockdown our sessions were remote, but still took place and I cannot tell you how lucky I felt to be able to have this support.</p><p>Thankfully, Mike's treatment begun in September 2020 and he is on way to recovery.

I know I'm always up to something, but this one will be a real challenge for me as I'm essentially rubbish at swimming, and I'm far more inclined to relax in warm waters with a beer in my hand than the cold British waters!  I will be attempting to swim 1.4 miles of open water sea swimming from Bournemouth pier to Boscombe Pier. With waves, currents and salt water this is going to be really hard work, and definitely outside of my comfort zone.  This is going to be even harder to train for due to lockdown restrictions closing my local pool, and the sea being outside my local vicinity to go and practise so I now have added incentive to hope that the lockdown restrictions all ease as anticipated!! </span><br/></p><p>A little under two years ago my mum was diagnosed with a degenerative aortic heart valve, which proceeded to degenerate at an alarming rate. From being active, independent and enjoying her daily walks, she rapidly lost confidence and the ability to manage even 200 metres without becoming breathless. Eventually she was admitted to hospital as an emergency case with less than 27% function of her heart, and the most she could do was walk 3 metres to an en suite bathroom and back.  One successful heart valve replacement and two months later (Feb 2021) she is now comfortably walking over a mile, is confident to drive and is rapidly regaining a quality of life which will hopefully last for the next 15 years.  The research and development of heart surgery has essentially given my mum her life back. She is one of the lucky ones.  </p><p>I'm raising money for the British Heart Foundation and I'd be so grateful for your support. The BHF has helped halve the number of people dying from heart and circulatory disease in the UK but sadly every day hundreds of people lose their lives, sadly including past friends of mine.  Every pound helps so please give what you can to help me hit my target.

This has been a hard year for everyone. Weve faced challenging times as a nation, and we know it's the small moments that bring people together. Such moments can be made possible for dying people and their loved ones by the expert care of Marie Curie Nurses, who can bring care, comfort and clarity at the very toughest time. 

Your support means the world to people affected by terminal illness.  From picking your daffodil in-store and wearing it with pride, to taking on your own fundraising challenge you're making vital care possible.

We follow their journey together as we see them trying to deal with this sudden change in both their lives. </p><p style=""color: #000000;"">Beach Baby began back in 2018. I had just found out at the time that my grandfather was diagnosed with cancer. When I went to see my grandfather my cousin was there and she had brought her newborn son to see him. When I saw my grandfather hold him, to me I saw life and death all at once. I wanted to make this film for him and for many families around the world who have had to be in that difficult position. Its themes are around loss and struggle while also about loving and acceptance. </p><p style=""color: #000000;"">My biggest inspiration for making this film was Spike Jonze’s 2013 film “Her”. I wanted to try and tell a story at times through visuals, I wanted to show times of happiness and times of sadness showcasing the ups and downs of life. My other inspiration was my loved ones who I have lost from cancer. I wanted to show my grandfather the film however he sadly passed away before the film was completed. </p><p style=""color: #000000;"">We shot Beach Baby over 7 days in 2019. I was extremely lucky to have such an incredible cast and crew be a part of this experience. Shane Brohan and Marie Devine gave everything they could for their performances in this film. We also ran an IndieGoGo campaign to raise funds for festivals and bring in a composer. By the end of March this year we successfully reached our £500 goal. </p><p style=""color: #000000;"">I really hope people enjoy this film as I have poured my heart and soul into this project for almost 3 years now and couldn’t be more proud of what myself and my crew accomplished. I feel extremely lucky to have worked with such a dedicated cast and crew. I also want to thank everyone that has contributed to this film through IndieGoGo and to my friends and family. </p><p><br/></p>",NA,NA,Beach Baby Online Release,0,0,0,0,0,NA,Online Release Of Beach Baby,Online Release Of Beach Baby,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Beach Baby Online Release,https://www.justgiving.com/BeachBabydonate,/BeachBabydonate,United Kingdom,,Beach Baby Online Release,//images.justgiving.com/image/a141eea8-9b38-49ca-895b-43f6798f1be4.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,19.401752,Matthew Killen,2021-02-24T17:47:34,50,6543901,2021-03-06T00:00:00,0,12130,7646f7a2-81f0-4613-93c2-77a3f3861164,Online Release Of Beach Baby,NA,Marie Curie,50,207994,50,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-02-25T07:04:45Z

He usually sailed from Burham-on-Crouch in Essex. He sailed for almost all of his life, and well into his eighties. He took part in many Burnham Weeks, competing well and finishing high up the listings for his class. Sailing was his main hobby and provided a break from his busy working life as a publican.  He had the misfortune to be involved in the now infamous Fastnet race where the value of the RNLI became obvious. As well as dad, they rescued many sailors during the time immediately after the gale struck.

Just £30 could provide a full kit to protect a health-worker on the frontline, including gloves, masks and coveralls, while just £43 could help provide 1,680 pairs of disposable gloves for health workers.
The impact of a large-scale outbreak of coronavirus on children, especially poor and vulnerable children, has been immense. Children are at risk from the disease, but also from the disruption to health and education services, impacts on caregivers, and separation from family members.
Unicef has been working closely with governments and the World Health Organization (WHO) since the start of the coronavirus outbreak. Donations made to my page will help to limit the spread of the virus and reduce the impact on children and families.
