As a team, Alice and Bryana will be running in the London Landmark Half Marathon to raise money for the British Heart Foundation on the 23rd May 2021.

The British Heart Foundation relies on this type of fundraising to allow them to continue their incremental work. This work includes developing new cures and creating new treatments for those suffering with heart and circulatory disease in the UK. The BHF have helped halve the number of people dying from these diseases, but sadly every day hundreds of people continue to lose  their lives. The BHF are dedicated to supporting on-going research with the goal of decreasing this number. As little as £24 can pay for two hours of research by an early career scientist. However, every pound counts and we are extremely grateful for whatever amount you can kindly give to help support this cause.

Thank you so much for reading and helping us fundraise for such an incredible charity.</p>",Bryana & Alice London Landmark Half Marathon for British Heart Foundation,0,0,0,0,0,true,true,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Alice Wiggings,858ef1bf-b554-4893-b9b1-39a9c212ea18,aliceandbryana,NA,London Landmarks Half Marathon 2021,https://www.justgiving.com/BryanaandAlicelandmarkhalfmarathon,/BryanaandAlicelandmarkhalfmarathon,United Kingdom,...<strong>Heart</strong> <strong>Foundation</strong>...,Bryana & Alice London Landmark Half Marathon for British Heart Foundation,//images.justgiving.com/image/292fb2a0-48b3-4eb0-ad56-985919862253.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,23.898294,Bryana Daniels,2020-12-29T19:53:59,183092,5223437,2021-05-23T00:00:00,350,641389,fa18d740-228a-4053-aa97-39c9a7fb9c64,NA,NA,British Heart Foundation,183092,225971,183092,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2020-12-30T06:22:18Z

For 7 days, his life was in the hands<br/>of a group of incredibly kind and talented people from various fields of<br/>medicine, who did everything possible to save him. <br/><br/><br/><br/>After a phenomenal and momentarily odds-defying fight, his body proved it was<br/>unable to cope with the levels of protein necessary to live on, and we had to<br/>let him go.
