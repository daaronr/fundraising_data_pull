The lifeboat was named after a popular local teenager Ollie Naismith who sadly died in a tragic road traffic accident in 2009. Ollies parents, Maxine and John Naismith spearheaded a fundraising campaign to raise the funds for the lifeboat which has gone on to save many lives in and around Looe including the life of Louis Webber, a young local lad who was of a similar age to Ollie. 

The lifeboat is now coming to the end of its operational life so the team at Looe Lifeboat station are teaming up with the Naismiths and Webber family to launch the Looe Lifeboat Appeal to raise the £78,000 required to provide a replacement lifeboat which will be named the Ollie Naismith II.

Your donation to this community appeal will help to fund this lifeboat which will continue the selfless work of our volunteer lifeboat crew in Looe.",Allan's Bathpool 2 Looe walk on stilts,0,0,0,0,0,"Walking 16,1 miles on stilts from bathpool 2 Looe because To help get the  Ollie Naismith to Looe 👌🏻","Walking 16,1 miles on stilts from bathpool 2 Looe",To help get the  Ollie Naismith to Looe 👌🏻,https://images.justgiving.com/image/414ce04b-1bf2-4edf-8193-0313d7c27056.jpg,https://images.justgiving.com/image/414ce04b-1bf2-4edf-8193-0313d7c27056.jpg?template=size150x150face,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3b8ff11c-ca1f-4502-9bcd-8ac34aada7e2,NA,Bathpool 2 Looe ,https://www.justgiving.com/Bathpool2looe,/Bathpool2looe,United Kingdom,,Allan's Bathpool 2 Looe walk on stilts,//images.justgiving.com/image/e502695a-611f-4a38-8cc4-61492ebda538.png?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,19.899376,Allan Gafney,2021-10-28T06:48:41,11200,7124123,2022-03-04T00:00:00,5000,13270,7bdd8c78-3cc6-4bab-b9ca-d9ee6dcded73,"Walking 16,1 miles on stilts from bathpool 2 Looe",To help get the  Ollie Naismith to Looe 👌🏻,RNLI - Royal National Lifeboat Institution,11200,209603,11200,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-10-28T18:22:30Z
