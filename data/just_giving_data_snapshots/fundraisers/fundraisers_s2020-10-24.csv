Since Macmillan Cancer Support and Cancer Research UK both played a role in his care, we are confident that donations to these two organisations honour Chris' life and values.<br/></p><p>Chris had thyroid cancer, and it was advanced by the time it was discovered in July 2020. He had tumours in many parts of his body, particularly his lungs. He was resolute in his efforts to get treatment that we all hoped would prolong his life. After a successful thyroidectomy, he went home to recuperate, but in the weeks afterwards he started to have breathing troubles that meant he was admitted to hospital. Unfortunately, he passed away suddenly there, which was a shock to those closest to him, who were hours earlier making plans for him to come home to hospice care. His memory lives on through his family and friends. He was deeply loved and will be dearly missed.</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to visit my JustGiving page.</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

You could complete 100 metres, 100 minutes, 100 days  be creative!

The sponsorship money you raise will make a difference. £100 could pay for five hours' training at a Guide Dogs training school.
