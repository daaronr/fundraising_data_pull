I wanted to do something to raise money this year due to the problems charities are experiencing in raising funds due to lockdown and  Covid19. I wanted to do something that would take me out of my comfort zone as in my work I am always pushing others to do this.  I was diagnosed with breast cancer at the beginning of this year. </span><span>At the time I was petrified that I would need chemotherapy and lose my hair.  </span><span>I was fortunate it had been caught early and only needed a lumpectomy and radiotherapy.  Others are not so fortunate and indeed one of my best friends was also diagnosed with breast cancer this year and is currently undergoing chemotherapy.  Seeing one of your best buddies going through such harsh treatment and losing her hair is hard.  This just made me more keen to do something for charity this year and in particular for cancer research UK. Let's find a cure for this awful disease so that our grandchildren don't have to suffer in the same way.  </span></p><p style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Many woman actually choose not to have chemotherapy as they are scared about the hair loss. I do understand why as I was scared and I know my friend was too. Why do we put so much emphasis on our hair? I suppose it is part of us, part of our identity.  Your self-esteem and confidence is built into it.  The media dictates to us that woman will have long flowing locks of hair.  This is what it is to be feminine and to be seen as a woman! Therefore when deciding what to do for my fundraising the most obvious choice to take me out of my comfort zone was to get my 'flowing locks' shaved off, particularly so as my hair has not been cut for over a year now, since I had my diagnosis. My hair is the longest it has ever been since at primary school and once shaved will be the shortest it has ever been since I was born!!!  I really hope you will sponsor me to do this.  I am lucky as this is a choice I have made - others do not get this choice and have other awful side effects to put up with at the same time as losing their hair. I also know that my hair will start to grow back straight away. </p><p style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Together we can make cancer a disease of the past :) and feel proud of ourselves as a woman or man with or without hair.</p><p style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

I started running 4 years ago to improve my physical and mental wellbeing. My first Manchester marathon raised money for Motor Neurone Disease in memory of a friend who died from the illness. I then began running longer distances to see how far I could go. I’m now hooked on endurance running and I’ve made some great friends around the UK.<br/>This might be my last fundraiser. It may also be the longest point-to-point run of my life (215 Miles).  I will be starting from my Dad’s birthplace (Kilsyth, North Lanarkshire) and finishing in Preston. I’m going to trace the route travelled by Mum and Dad when they migrated from their birthplace to Preston in the early 1950s.  <br/>Alas my Dad, Tommy McAteer, ran out of steam on the 6th November 2020. He was 91 and I miss him very much. Mum died in 2011. Both Mum and Dad consistently encouraged me to be the best I can be. They always supported me to challenge myself. They taught me to know that I can make things happen by believing in myself. Before he died, Dad and I spent time discussing the practicalities of running from Kilsyth to Preston. We laughed when considering the weather, the hills I will encounter … but Dad never discouraged me from giving it a go. <br/>Why Marie Curie? Well, Dad’s active dying process lasted a week. He was in his own home. Much needed respite was given when the District Nurse team organised an overnight stay by a Marie Curie nurse (Amber). The opportunity this gave us as a family to recharge our batteries in our own homes was amazing. Marie Curie rely on donations to help them carry on providing this brilliant service to people with terminal illness and their carers. <br/>I will be posting regular updates to let you know how my preparations are going. I’m looking forward to standing on the start line in March 2021 and remembering my parents on my journey south whilst supporting the fabulous charity Marie Curie. <br/>Thanks for Donating and God bless Running.<br/>Tom</p>",Haggis to Hotpot..
