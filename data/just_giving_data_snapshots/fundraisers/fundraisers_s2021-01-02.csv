Even after I left the council, we stayed in touch and enjoyed many a good evening just talking nonsense whilst drinking (way too much alcohol). She also helped me through some very dark times in my own past as well, especially when I experienced a nasty attack on my way home alone one evening and I had to have the top of my left ear sewn back on. She got me back on my feet and also back out in the world when I was so scared to even venture out of my flat. I just wish I could have done more for her during her painful struggle of this horrible disease.</p><p>I've therefore decided to do a virtual challenge of the USA Route 66 in her memory that will culminate in me hopefully crossing the marathon finish line in Chester on Sunday the 3rd October 2021. My virtual challenge starts on the 1st January 2021 and consists of some 2,278 miles that I aim to complete on the 3rd October 2021, meaning I need to run/walk/cycle just over 250 miles a month to ensure when I cross the line in Chester I have completed the entire Route 66 in just over 9 months.</p><p>The marathon will only be my second, and I know just how hard they are but with Brione helping me along the 26.2 miles (and also all the training prior to the event) I am sure I will complete this in her memory.  </p><p>If you could therefore donate to such a worthy cause I would be eternally grateful. I will be providing a few goodies to be won by folk who kindly donate by asking them to predict my finish time of the marathon and those who come closest to my actual time will win something (Items to be confirmed well in advance of the marathon). For every £5 donated I'll let you have one guess at my finish time - to give you an idea I finished the London Marathon in April 2016 in a time of 4hrs 10 mins 26 secs - however I will be 5 and a bit yrs older with a few extra pounds in weight at the moment too.</p><p>Thanks again for taking the time to look at my just giving page and I will keep you all informed of my progress along the Route 66 as often as I can.</p><p>Mel</p>",Mel's page,5,0,20,4,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,In memory of Brione Abbott,https://www.justgiving.com/Mel-Wilson9,/Mel-Wilson9,United Kingdom,,Mel's page,//images.justgiving.com/image/Inmem_web.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true&sourcepath=Stock,Fundraiser,15.864895,Mel Wilson,2021-01-01T21:02:18,2116,6437401,2021-01-01T21:02:18,500,13507,e55f9de0-ef12-4eb7-87e0-ed26e94acc1f,I'm hoping to raise much needed funds,I lost a very dear & close friend in October 2020,Macmillan Cancer Support,2116,261017,2116,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-01-02T06:22:42Z

While we continue to rebuild our lives without him in it, he is never far from our thoughts.  All I can do for Lee now is to try to make him proud every day and to continue the fundraising he started in memory of him so please please do support me if you can.

This time last year Lyla was on day 12 of 20 on life support (ECMO) before the doctors decided she was fit enough to go through life saving surgery to fit her with a mechanical device that would be a bridge to getting her a heart transplant. At 15 months old, and after such a long period of inactivity, Lyla had to learn to do everything again, from using her diaphragm to breathe, lifting her neck, I mean everything.<br /><br />Throughout all of this we had an incredible team of doctors, nurses, physios, play specialists, occupational therapists and so many more at great Ormond Street hospital (GOSH) who all helped Lyla not only get through to transplant, but to be in the best shape for after so that she would not only survive but thrive with her new gift. <br /><br />And how she has. 16 days after her transplant and we were home. Every day she makes such leaps it astounds us both, and today she took her first steps on her own. We now have an energetic and very sassy 2 year old on our hands!<br /><br />None of this would have been possible without the amazing team at GOSH, so for January I have signed up to run 31 miles in 31 days and would love to raise some money for a charity that has helped to save our daughter's life.

Uncle Tony was extremely funny and lived life to the full despite his numerous health conditions. He would always tell us of how naughty he was growing up and would forever be making us laugh!! Uncle Tony</span><span> had been diagnosed with Prostate Cancer and fought it for 6 years despite being told he would make it that far!! Sadly Uncle Tony passed away this year. R.I.P Uncle Tony</span></p><p><span>Last but not least an incredible women that we are both proud to know Theresa Harris. Theresa is Becky's mum's cousin who got diagnosed with Breast Cancer on her 53rd Birthday! What a shock for all! It was her first ever check up and thank God she went! Theresa is one of the moment amazing ladies we know, kind, caring and so much fun to be around. She is an absolute warrior and kicked cancer's butt!!

We hope to raise some money for Cancer Research UK whilst doing this, to try and raise awareness and make a difference, however small this new year. </p><p><b><u>MUMS MISSION STATEMENT</u></b>:- Myself and my boys have lost loved ones or still have family members being affected by cancer, and it’s a topic that comes up a lot in our house. “What is cancer?” “What does it do?”  “Why has it taken them away?” “Will we get it?” “Can you stop it?”  I try my best to be honest with the boys and explain my answers in the most appropriate way, but it’s a difficult topic and one that I know brings up uncomfortable feelings and conversations. I thought it would help them deal with things if we could do something positive that would give them a sense of achievement, in honour of our loved ones, past and present. So we decided to run a combined total of 250 miles this January. </p><p><b><u>JACKS MISSION STATEMENT</u></b>:- “I have decided to run 100 miles in January for cancer research because cancer is a horrible thing. My auntie Tina, Grandad Dave and uncle Ste all died from this terrible illness. I really hope I can do this for everyone and raise a lot of money. Jack”</p><p><b><u>MYLES MISSION STATEMENT</u></b>:- “Because my Grandad died because he had cancer and I miss him and I am going to run 50 Myles for my Grandad xxx. Myles”</p><p>Jack (10) and I (old*) will run 100 miles each (avg. 3.23 miles per day) and Myles (7)  will run 50 miles (avg. 1.61 miles per day). We will mostly be running outside on the roads, but some of our miles will be run indoors on the treadmill due to Rob working and January weather. But miles are miles, no matter where we have run them! :) </p><p>We are hoping to hit a target of £250, that’s a £1 for every mile we run. We hope that you are able to donate, no matter how small, but if you can’t then a like and share will be great so the boys can see the support they have to spur them on. We will be keeping a diary of our runs so people can see our progress and see where we are up to on our targets.

I'm guilty of that too, until now. <br/><br/>I desperately want to get myself in shape in time for our wedding this year, but its not just my figure I want to feel better, it's my headspace too. I've never looked after myself, I've never drank enough water, I've never been mindful of what I eat, I have no energy or enthusiasm to cook so either Nick cooks or I eat rubbish, or even not at all. Sometimes I don't feel worthy of looking after myself because I'm already too far gone. I want to change the way I feel about myself and that starts with my diet and exercise.<br/><br/>I've decided this year I want to take part in various challenges that I can do either from home or round the village, and I thought what better way to see me through till the end than rasing money along the way. There's no backing out this way which will just push my motivation even further. <br/><br/>Instead of lots of small fundraisers I've decided to set up 1 fundraiser for a charity that ultimately means the most to me, Cancer Research. I won't go into it too much but mostly for my Dad who I lost to cancer, and other family and friends too over the years. <br/><br/>The idea is I'll be completing 1 challenge a month for the next 9 months. I've decided to start with an easy one, the 10 Day 5K challenge which I'll probably walk to begin with &#129315; I'll document my challenges too so there's no avoiding it, and what better day to start it than today, the 1st day of the year.<br/><br/>If you'd like to set me a challenge for the months ahead, I'd love to hear your ideas!<br/><br/>Thank you in advance for any donations no matter how big or small &#128591;&#128151;<br/><br/><br/><br/><!--/data/user/0/com.samsung.android.app.notes/files/clipdata/clipdata_bodytext_210101_100313_321.sdocx--><br/></p>",Anna's Monthly Challenges,0,0,0,0,0,true,true,true,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Anna's Monthly Challenges,https://www.justgiving.com/Anna-Johnstone2,/Anna-Johnstone2,United Kingdom,,Anna's Monthly Challenges,//images.justgiving.com/image/whistle_web.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true&sourcepath=Stock,Fundraiser,13.830163,Anna Johnstone,2021-01-01T09:22:14,2357,6435301,2021-01-01T09:22:14,500,13174,85f72e93-1a21-4814-9027-f0a796a75ad5,NA,NA,Cancer Research UK,2357,1089464,2357,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-01-02T06:22:42Z
