Run 4 miles every 4 hours for 48 hours straight. That’s almost 2 marathons in 2 days.</p><p style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245);"">Despite its simplicity, the 4x4x48 is a pressing test of resilience, endurance and willpower. Whilst 4 miles isn’t a major strain for most athletes, it’s the frequency of needing to run them which makes this challenge tough.</p><p style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245);"">Because you have to put in 4 miles every 4 hours, you can’t get quality sleep. Sure, you might get the odd two and a half hours but the alarm bell will soon ring ordering you out of the comfortable bed and into the running shoes for another 4 miles.</p><p style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245);"">Some find the wear and tear on the body particularly difficult. The first three or four 4-mile runs will be fine for most athletes but the constant running will soon result wear you out. Your muscles will start feeling sorer as the challenge progresses, and each run will become harder to maintain than the last.</p><p style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245);"">The 4x4x48 challenge is also tough due to the willpower required. It’s easy to motivate yourself to run once or maybe even twice in a day but having to do so 12 times in 2 days is a sheer willpower test. Whilst you may be reading this thinking ‘easy, I’ll be able to take that on’, I guarantee you that (from personal experience) it’s a totally different conversation you’ll have with yourself when it’s 4AM on the second day and you’re exhausted.</p><!--EndFragment--><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p>",Anthony / Chris / Scott / Leon 4x4x48,12.50,0,50,0,0,OtherPersonalChallenge,NA,https://images.justgiving.com/image/7c554fcd-bb35-43f5-86c2-6595d29cb8e5.jpg,https://images.justgiving.com/image/7c554fcd-bb35-43f5-86c2-6595d29cb8e5.jpg?template=size150x150face,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,13e0e2d0-0596-476c-9fea-9652b98e12b0,Letsgo4x4x48,NA,NA,NA,NA,Anthony / Chris / Scott / Leon 4x4x48,https://www.justgiving.com/firth-scott,/firth-scott,United Kingdom,,Anthony / Chris / Scott / Leon 4x4x48,//images.justgiving.com/image/7f360c43-05ba-488b-9260-7ffe209f09c4.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,15.557264,Scott Firth,2021-02-26T12:52:23,2116,6546015,2021-02-26T12:50:15,0,13507,b9ac28a6-ef91-43b6-b472-9e19d5062e0c,NA,NA,Macmillan Cancer Support,2116,261017,2116,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-02-27T07:03:15Z

That has meant that I’m pretty much useless beyond a day at work, and am really struggling with pain after minimal exercise. So I’m struggling with shifting my lockdown boredom eating weight (!) and doing any fitness based challenges. This feels like the perfect alternative!
