I have decided to take on a marathon on Sunday May 30th  (possibly in a virtual environment) to pay tribute to my late mother and in support of Macmillan.  </p><p><span>My Mum, Marion was diagnosed with cancer of unknown primary in late May 2019. Mum started experiencing symptoms just after our Dad sadly passed away in December 2018. This was Mum's second battle with cancer having been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007. Mum was determined to fight this disease as she did back in 2007 regardless of the terminal diagnosis she was given in May 2019. She set herself goals &amp; targets despite the odds, Mum was determined to see Christmas however in August 2019 she found out her 6th grandchild was due in April 2020 and this became her new target to meet her granddaughter.</span></p><div class=""jg-pages-section__content jg-space-plmd@xl jgp-QyPsj"" style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);""><p>Mum wanted to stay as independant as possible, despite her deterioration she continued to stay at home and live as much of a normal life as she was able to. This must have been an unimaginable challenge with this disease attacking her mobility, diet, digestion and soaking up her energy every minute of everyday.</p><p><span>Mum dedicated her life to serve the National Health Service with over 50 years service in various roles including Safeguarding Lead and the family know how proud she was of the NHS and carers battling this horrible Covid virus. </span></p><p><span>Having helped mum since her diagnosis and throughout the pandemic really shows to me how this virus impacts so many people indirectly and charities like Macmillan now need support more then ever. Supporting people living with cancer means so much, not only to the person but their families too and to continue providing vital support despite the pandemic makes it even more important. </span></p><p>Mum died surrounded by her family at Bassetlaw Hospice on April 25th exactly a week after her Granddaughter was born. Mum was able to meet her and have her picture taken with her, a photo we will treasure as a tribute to Mum's strength, determination &amp; love for life. </p><p>Thank you for your donation, on behalf of Marion &amp; familiy it is greatly appreciated.</p></div>",In memory of a wonderful mother,0,0,0,0,0,NA,I am attempting the Edinburgh marathon in May because In memory of my late mother Marion Corbett,I am attempting the Edinburgh marathon in May,In memory of my late mother Marion Corbett,Marion Corbett,832389,Marion Corbett,/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/13691309,remember/832389,NA,NA,NA,In memory of Marion Corbett,https://www.justgiving.com/JH-CORBETT,/JH-CORBETT,United Kingdom,,In memory of a wonderful mother,//images.justgiving.com/image/4c705836-5aa5-4951-8b35-8c67a88616c7.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,15.897998,JH CORBETT,I am attempting the Edinburgh marathon in May,In memory of my late mother Marion Corbett,2021-01-16T06:30:32,2116,6463990,2021-01-16T06:30:32,750,13507,18e95344-e633-4f7b-8761-3a2eb5d19a8e,Macmillan Cancer Support,2116,261017,2116,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-01-17T07:03:48Z
