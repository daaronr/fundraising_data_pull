Both our family and my Mum were very grateful for their endless kindness and support. My Mum was so sad to leave them when she was moved to Kirkcaldy Hospice. We are also eternally grateful for all of the incredible staff at the hospice and will be looking to do a separate fundraiser later in the year as a thank you to them as well. We can’t thank the NHS and Macmillan enough for all the the incredible support they showed us during the hardest time of our lives.

Anyone that knows me will know how much I love chocolate and my grandad certainly helped with my chocolate fixation as a young girl (often hiding my stash in his jacket pocket so my younger sisters wouldn't find it and I would be made to share) Since grandad passed away I have personally donated to the British Heart Foundation, sponsored an engraving in his memory on the BHF Heart of Steel and now I am taking part in the BHF DeChox which shall see me give up chocolate, sweets and fizzy drinks for the month of March 2021.

For those that have known me for many years, you know this isn’t the first time I’ve raised money for charity. Back In 2013 and 2014 I raised money for children charities by trekking the Great Wall of China and then running the London Marathon. I raised a lot of money around £7000 in total but when I saw this challenge on Facebook I thought this is for me. </p><p><span>I’ve trained to walk 10 days in China , I’ve trained to complete 26.2 miles running without stopping and I’ve swum the equivalent of the channel to France but the thought of not been able to eat chocolate for 31 days seems like the impossible for me. I’d happily walk 10,000 steps a day , give up alcohol for a year and maybe just maybe train for a 10k but really no chocolate for a whole 31 days ???? </span></p><p><span>For those that truly know me ,they know I am a chocoholic. They know that during a night shift I will call at the 24hr garage and buy bags of share bag chocolates and just sit and eat the lot to myself, how I will never just eat a normal amount of chocolate recommended in one sitting , how I find it acceptable to sit and eat a whole tub of celebrations in one go. I am never that far away from the sweet stuff. The truth is I am a chocoholic and there isn’t a day that goes by where I don’t feed my addiction. </span></p><p><span>So please believe me when I say , I think signing up for this challenge and doing a whole 31 days will be that ... a true challenge. I recently downloaded an app to help with my addiction and so far I’ve managed a total streak for 4 days and that’s me trying. </span></p><p><span>So please sponsor me to complete what I believe will be the biggest challenge I’ve ever signed up for . Knowing you are supporting me by donating your well earned cash is what will keep me going , knowing we are raising money for the British Heart Foundation and all the people they help.  </span></p><p><span>Thank you ! Please follow me during the month of March on my socials to see how I get on. </span></p><p><span>Please see below a few words from the charity - </span></p><p><span>The pandemic is the biggest challenge we've faced in our 60 year history.

The reason for me deciding to <span style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);float: none;"">undertake this challenge is to raise awareness for Endocarditis. </span></p><p>Unfortunately, due to covid restrictions we were unable to receive donations at my father’s funeral, therefore we<span style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);float: none;""> will at a later date (when it is safe to do so) organise something in my father’s memory to raise much needed funds for the Welsh Air Ambulance. </span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>My beloved father and much loved Tadcu died on 30th March 2020 after contracting Endocarditis (infection of the replacement valve in his heart). He received open heart surgery in 2018 to replace his own failing valve. He recovered from this surgery, however later on in the following year he developed an infection in the replacement valve. After months of suffering and failed treatments he was given one last chance of recovery in the form of open heart surgery to remove the infection around the valve. He was given a 50/50 chance of surviving the surgery. During this surgery they also replaced the valve. He survived the surgery, however he returned following it in a critical condition and died 2 days later.</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>Due to Covid restrictions we were unable to be with my father when he needed us the most. To our heartache and devastation, my father had to endure the most terrifying </span><span>days of his life alone, and his life ending by him passing away alone at the hospital. </span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>The purpose for my undertaking this challenge is to raise much needed awareness of Endocarditis. Had we have known about this condition and it’s symptoms following the initial replacement valve surgery in 2018, we feel that the loss of my father could have been prevented. Effective treatment of this condition needs to be undertaken at the earliest opportunity possible. Therefore by doing this challenge I hope to raise awareness of this complication to others who have a replacement valve or may do so in the future. Combined with this, any donations raised in the process will help fund further research for the British Heart Foundation as a tribute to my late father. </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p>Information from the British Heart Foundation:</p><p>The pandemic is the biggest challenge we've faced in our 60 year history.

My coach (Ben Heron) and I have decided to organise an event whereby we run the distance from the most northern part of mainland Ireland, Malin Head (County Donegal), to the most southern part of the island, Brow Head (County Cork) in the space of 24 hours. The total distance between these two regions is roughly 302 miles (486km), making this event extremely challenging! Members of the Level Up Academy along with their close friends and family will be involved in the event, each running varied distances that will contribute to the overall distance achieved on April 4th 2021. We felt that during these difficult times, this would be great opportunity for people to get involved in an event that adds a sense of purpose to their exercise, whilst raising money for an extremely worthy cause. This event is ultimately in memory of my incredible Dad who sadly passed away in his sleep on the 16th October 2017 to a suspected cardiac arrest at 50 years of age. Through raising awareness of cardiovascular disease and the impacts it has on so many families, we are also keeping my Dad's legacy alive and no doubt doing him extremely proud.</p><p>I would like to take the opportunity, on behalf of my family and I, to thank you for your donation regardless of the amount.

Despite the diagnosis we were told most kids live fairly normal lives and we did not know the full impact of this condition. </span></p><p><span><span style=""color: #262626;"">When Krish was a year old, he developed a problem with one of his legs and had to wear a splint to help protect it. Other than that, Krish lived a very healthy and happy life. He learnt how to ride a bike, he loved school, he was great with numbers, enjoyed eating out, going on holiday but most importantly he loved spending time with his family. </span></span></p><p><span>Sadly, in October 2020 Krish, aged 5, very suddenly and quickly became unwell. On the 18th October he was admitted at GOSH for emergency brain surgery. As the days went by, we were told of the severity of what was happening to him. He was diagnosed with an inoperable malignant brain tumour. There was nothing we could do to save our son. </span><span>As parents we decided to fight for Krish and help him get stronger to be able </span><span>to complete radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatment. This was never going to </span><span>cure Krish but would buy us some time with our precious little boy. </span><span><br/></span></p><p><span>As we got ready to start treatment Krish's tumour grew rapidly and sadly he was unable to start treatment. He died in our arms on 9th December at 17:42 leaving us totally devastated. </span></p><p><span>Krish was a very strong and brave boy, he was a real superhero.<br/>We had to make tough decisions for him. When we decided to put Krish through treatment, he decided he did not want this, he must have thought he would suffer and so would we. We were then getting ready to bring him home to spend his last days with us, even then Krish decided he did not want us to remember him this way at home. He died in hospital surrounded by his family. </span></p><p><span>The speed with how all this happened is still something we are<br/>struggling to understand. During the seven weeks we were at GOSH the care and compassion we experienced was exceptional and we will always be very grateful to the Koala and Intensive care wards.The medical, nursing and support staff were outstanding, we never doubted the care Krish received.</span></p><p><span>We also now know that the prognosis of these types of tumors is not good and there is very little funding allocated to research in this life destroying field. This type of cancer kills many children, despite this, there is very little funding allocated to research . Therefore, we have decided to help raise funds for GOSH to be able to carry out clinical trials and research in this area.</span></p><p><span>All funds will be allocated to Koala ward and to research of these specific brain tumors. </span></p><p><span>We really want Krish's life to mean something, and we would like<br/>him to continue to be in our memories. <span>For those that knew Krish, you will know he was kind, clever, happy and a very loving beautiful boy. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Please share this page with family and friends and help us keep Krish in our memories.Any little thing that we can do in Krish’s  memory that can help other children and parents , will be  helpful.</span></span></p><p><span><span style=""color: #262626;"">Every donation helps Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity to provide the best facilities and equipment, research and develop new treatments, and support their remarkable patients and their families.</span></span></p><p><span>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.<br/>Your details are safe with JustGiving - they'll never sell them nor send<br/>unwanted emails.
