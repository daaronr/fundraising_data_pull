Premier Inn &amp; Restaurants team members, guests and suppliers across the country raised £7.5 million towards the Premier Inn Clinical Building, a seven-floor facility with spacious inpatient wards and state-of-the-art operating theatres, which was officially opened in January 2018.<br/><br/>In 2017 Whitbread committed to continue the partnership with GOSH Charity and raise a further £10 million towards a new Sight and Sound Centre at the Hospital.<br/><br/>When it opens in 2020 the new centre will be the UK’s first dedicated medical facility for children with sight and hearing loss. In one dedicated building, the centre will house specialist outpatient facilities for the Audiology and Ophthalmology departments including state-of-the-art soundproofed booths, an eye imaging suite, a dispensing optician and other testing facilities.<br/><br/>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

The spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) has unthinkable consequences in the places CARE is already delivering lifesaving aid  places where healthcare systems are already weak, and where disaster and conflict have wiped out long-term food supplies. In these communities there are far too many vulnerable people and too few resources to fight a deadly virus like this.

CARE are building on past experience responding to outbreaks of infectious disease in vulnerable communities taking particular note that emergencies, including health crises, tend to disproportionately affect women and girls.
