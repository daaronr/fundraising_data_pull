Living with these have not always been easy mainly because of it being an invisible illness, it’s not something you can see but presents itself in some unpleasant ways.<br/><br/>Sometimes it triggers anxiety attacks because the decrease in oxygenated blood travelling to my lungs means I just can’t catch my breathe properly, this in turn can make me feel extremely fatigued no matter how much I “sleep it off”. I annoyingly find myself cancelling on a lot of social events just because I’m so tired I can’t even explain and always hearing “go to bed earlier” or “you’ll be alright I’m tired too” and not wanting to go into detail or look like I’m “playing” on my illness. <br/><br/>When I eventually decide to have my own family, I put myself in a high risk category and have to be monitored closely by cardiologists for my whole pregnancy because of concerns my heart won’t deal with the added pressure well and added risk that I will miscarry or give birth to a baby who is much smaller than it should be, or even me passing my heart problems to the baby. <br/><br/>There are a few things I haven’t mentioned such as dizziness, fainting, heart palpitations and staying away from too much alcohol/caffeine incase it triggers AF and having to carry emergency medication “just incase” my heart decides to play up when I’m not near a hospital to name a few.<br/><br/>Anyway skipping into the actual point of this post: because of my own experiences and meeting people with different heart conditions I’ve always held one charity really close to my heart: The British Heart foundation. <br/><br/>I have completed two charity swims in the last few years swimming the distance of the English Channel to raise money so far I’ve raised around £3,000 and I’m hoping in the next few weeks to do my third swim! This time I’ll be completing the equivalent of a marathon which is 26.2 miles (1,664 lengths). I’ll be setting up a just giving page in the next few weeks and I’d really appreciate donations towards the BHF and the great work they do to keeping hearts beating ❤️ please keep an eye on my page for details!<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Thanks for visiting my page. I'm raising money for the British Heart Foundation and I'd be so grateful for your support. The BHF has helped halve the number of people dying from heart and circulatory disease in the UK but sadly every day hundreds of people lose their lives. It's only thanks to support from people like us that the BHF can create new treatments and discover new cures. £24 could pay for two hours of research by an early career scientist, but every pound helps so please give what you can to help me hit my target.

Our new Never Far Away: Essex Appeal aims to raise vital funds to support parent and family accommodation at GOSH. £300,000 will give families precious nights close to their children whilst they receive treatment at GOSH. 


We are asking the people of Essex to get behind this appeal, together we can make a massive difference to the families who are going through a very stressful time, if we can ease one worry then it is worth it. Whether you can raise £1 or £100; it will make an impact to so many families. 

A 7-night stay for 2 adults in a budget hotel 15 minutes from the hospital would cost a staggering £815. This is simply not affordable for most families.
