Sometimes I wondered if he actually even had cancer, he was always trying to chat up the bloody nurses haha! It never seemed real until it hit in the last couple of months. That’s when you start to see what this horrible disease causes. But, even then, my dad stayed strong, and he always had a smile on his face.

I have also lost  other family members due to heart related illnesses and disease. Most recently, I lost my beautiful Auntie who simply shouldn't have been taken from us so soon, she had the kindest heart and soul and we miss her so much ❤️ As a family, you can imagine we are devastated and the heartache we have felt is indescribable. We don't want others to have to experience the heartache we have felt by losing a loved one.

I know I'm not running or cycling hundreds of miles to fundraise but anyone who knows me, will know how much I love chocolate and lots of it too.

It is my one true love, my achilles heel, my weak point. Not a glass of wine on a Friday night, or a virtual shopping trip. It's the gooeyyyest brownies, the super yum cookies / doughnuts, the large bar of choc that gets me the most. Especially during the past year. </p><p><span>I've been doing some research on sugar. The benefits (they are minimal) and the science behind what sugar does to your body. It seems that we're all slightly addicted (or worse) because it is in everything we eat basically. I want to set the reset button and see if it can make a difference. I even got to a point around 2 years ago when my mental health was at a low, where I ate sugar such as chocolate instead of meals. As I have been exploring going booze-free when possible and not smoking when </span>socialising<span>, sugar has stepped up to fill those gaps. To summarise...this is a big challenge for me. </span></p><p><span>We sadly lost our Nan recently and although she had a great and full life, she also suffered with strokes and diabetes. To be honest it kinda seems ironic doing this challenge in her memory as she was the biggest cake and biscuit lover of all! But, I think she would have liked the sentiment and I'd really like to raise some money for the charity to honour her and all she did for us during her lifetime.  We called her 'Nanny Daniel'. She was my mum's mum and she was a modest, headstrong and </span>independent<span> woman. From what I remember of her in the more recent years, she didn't talk too much and I'm not sure if this was related to the strokes she had. Or maybe it was due to a kind of contentment you reach later on in life. When I was young she would take me and my 567 other cousins on the train to the beach and I have no idea why she did that because there was so many of us - it must have been a nightmare haha. She would often go on train trips with our G</span>randdad<span> bring me back a paper bag of my favourite sweets, 'toothbrushes and teeth'. Oh the nostalgia! And again, the irony. </span></p><p><span>As much as I love-d sweets, at the age of 29, I'd like to try something new. For my health and to celebrate the life of our beloved Nanny Daniel, I'm giving up the sweet stuff for 30 days. I'm going to be removing refined sugar from my diet as much as possible, whilst allowing myself small amounts of natural sugar from fruits. </span><br/></p><p>Things I will not be eating / drinking (and for each thing there is a £5 penalty): c<span>hocolate, sweets, cake of any form (doughnuts, cookies, biscuits), fizzy drinks, alcohol, anything that has an obvious amount of refined sugar! I will allow myself bread but will be mindful with how much I eat.</span></p><p><span>And if you've got this far - thank you for your support!</span></p><p><span>Bex </span></p><p><span>x </span><br/></p><p><span>PS please always Gift Aid :) - the charity can claim back 25% of your donation from tax you have paid at no cost to you! It's a no-brainer. </span></p><p><br/></p><p>A lil bit from the British Heart Foundation:</p><p><span>The pandemic is the biggest challenge we've faced in our 60 year history.

Some of the people we support stay in our in-patient unit, where relatives and friends can visit any time of the day or night and stay with their loved ones if they wish to.

We also support local people with clinics, therapies and activities during the day  including one-to-one care, groups and things like reiki and massage. 

As well as people with a terminal illness, we also support carers and families with things like bereavement support groups where people can share their experiences and feelings.

Its a warm and welcoming place where we give expert care to people with a terminal illness, and their loved ones, every day of the year. 

Our hospice team includes doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, social workers and many more, and is supported by over 200 volunteers  who play a vital role in the running of the hospice.

We have a 24-bed in-patient unit, where relatives and friends can visit any time of the day or night, and stay with their loved ones if they wish.

Our out-patient unit offers clinics, therapies and group sessions  and freshly cooked lunches made by our chefs. We also support carers and families, including children, with practical advice, counselling and bereavement support groups.

We need to raise £9,600 per day to run the hospice, so every penny counts. Thank you for helping to make sure more people with a terminal illness in Solihull get the care and support they need.
