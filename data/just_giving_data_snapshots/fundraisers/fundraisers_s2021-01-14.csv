Not exactly what we were expecting for Christmas but these are the cards that we’ve been dealt and the only way to tackle them is head on with positivity, love and a touch of humour.<br/><br/>As always my Mum has not wasted any time with self pity or negativity and has got straight into her treatment plan, and this week (w/c 11th Jan 2021) has undergone the first phase of extensive surgery to tackle the cancer. After a short recovery period she will then begin a 4 month chemotherapy treatment plan to hopefully rid her of any remaining cancerous cells and start the road to recovery. But as with all chemotherapy treatments there are serious side effects, one of which includes hair loss.<br/><br/>So, it is with this in mind that we want to show our love and support for our beautiful mum by shaving off our luxurious locks (some more luxurious that others) to raise much needed money for MacMillan Cancer Support, who do amazing work supporting cancer patients along with their family and friends.<br/><br/>For each £200 raised me, my brother and 3 close friends will shave off our hair when the targets are met. Personally, as someone who has been losing his hair since his late 20’s the thought of shaving my hair off makes my &#34;V05 Matt paste&#34; tremble with fear. But, this pales into insignificance when you compare to the challenge my mum is facing with her cancer treatment. This is the very least we can do to show her that she’ll not be alone during this battle and that her family and friends are here with her every  step of the way.<br/><br/>We really do appreciate that these are unprecedented times we are living in and any donation, however small, is greatly appreciated.<br/><br/>So, in the words of Sue and Mel... <br/>“On Your Marks,,, Get Set,,, Donate...!!!”<br/><br/>P.S.

His symptoms were not those of a typical heart attack; there were no chest pains, no shortness of breath. He simply felt under the weather and kept having indigestion symptoms.</p><p>February 2015 was a day to remember for all the wrong reasons. Dad set off for a bike ride with his Brother John in the morning; without warning he suffered an out of hospital cardiac arrest less than a minute from home. His heart went into VF arrest; his Brother and a passer by performed CPR whilst an ambulance responder and ambulance were just minutes away who continued to work in his heart and they eventually stabilised him at Barnsley hospital before being transported to Sheffield’s Northern General Hospital. Here he was placed in an induced coma and had hypothermic therapy, to aid recovery of his brain. My Dad absolutely blew away all of the health care professionals with his strength and determination which saw him make a full recovery despite a 3% chance of survival. What a hero!!! </p><p>I remember a physiotherapist saying that she wished she could bottle my Dad’s determination, as it was incredible. He was our absolute hero.</p><p>Dad returned to work, carried on cycling and enjoyed many more hobbies moving forward from his cardiac arrest. He also created many beautiful memories with me, my Mum Julie, and Elliott his Son-in-law; he enjoyed his trips away, especially to Italy and to Malham in the Yorkshire Dales.</p><p>Dad also gave me away when I got married in Mexico in March 2018; an experience which I was very privileged to have.</p><p>Dad loved cycling; it brought him a great sense of achievement and happiness over the years, as well as keeping him fit and healthy. He was cycling until the very end.</p><p>On 3rd January 2021 whilst “Zwifting” with me on a virtual ride, Dad suddenly collapsed and died at home. Despite the best efforts of the paramedics and air ambulance, this time Dad couldn’t be brought back. He died doing his most favourite activity at home. </p><p>My Mum and I are still coming to terms with Dad not being here anymore. It has been a complete shock for us and we can’t imagine life without him. </p><p>We want to donate to the British Heart Foundation to help prevent others from experiencing the same heartbreak that we have experienced as a family.</p><p>Thank you for reading.</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

She’s always an inspiration in my life and continues to defy what everyone assumes she can be having a life limiting condition!

Gavin became Commercial Officer on our Committee, and was instrumental in organising the GFSN national football tournament here in Liverpool in summer 2019. He single-handedly managed to bag Liverpool's Town Hall for the evening social event – nothing smaller would do, and it was a fantastic night!</p><p>Gav was passionate at promoting and driving our Club forward. He did not shy away from the limelight – and made appearances in the Liverpool Echo, BBC Radio Merseyside and even on Granada Reports! <span>Gavin was a fierce competitor on the pitch too. He was not shy of a tackle and a word with the opposition, ref or even his own team! The no 25 shirt will always be Gavin's.</span></p><p>Gav loved socialising, and always travelled around the UK with the Club to play in away matches. In Summer 2019 he travelled with a group of Marauders to Rome to play in a European tournament, which he loved every minute of. <span>Gavin was funny, caring and intelligent, he had many close friends on the team. He will be dearly missed by us all.</span></p><p>Marie Curie Hospice in Liverpool gave Gavin outstanding care in the latter stages of his life. We are asking for donations to Marie Curie in his memory. </p><p>Here is some more information about the vital work they do:</p><p>'At the Marie Curie Hospice, Liverpool, we give expert care to people with a terminal illness, and their loved ones every day of the year. Our hospice team includes doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, social workers and many more, and is supported by local people who freely volunteer their time and energy to help us run the hospice. As well as being a place where people can stay to get the expert care they need in a friendly and homely setting, we also support people visiting with clinics and therapies. These include yoga, exercise classes and relaxation. People using the day unit can also get together over a freshly cooked lunch from our chefs. Relatives and friends can visit any time of the day or night, and stay with their loved ones if they wish to. We need to raise £6,397 per day to run the hospice, so every penny counts. Thank you for helping to make sure more people with a terminal illness in in Liverpool, get the care and support they need.'</p><p>Our thoughts are with all of Gavin's family and friends, and his partner Adam during this time. </p>",NA,NA,In memory of Gavin Whitfield,127.50,0,759.33,152,0,NA,NA,https://images.justgiving.com/image/bda36e75-999f-4ea3-97d1-20164b8b41fa.jpg,https://images.justgiving.com/image/bda36e75-999f-4ea3-97d1-20164b8b41fa.jpg?template=size150x150face,NA,da61e689-6bc1-4c87-9d99-436aee550782,NA,NA,NA,NA,In memory of Gavin Whitfield,https://www.justgiving.com/Gavin-Whitfield,/Gavin-Whitfield,United Kingdom,,In memory of Gavin Whitfield,//images.justgiving.com/image/9ed4c124-68b3-4736-b3e5-6e558d954bfe.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,21.370502,Francis Wight,We are asking for donations,of the great care they gave to Gavin.,2021-01-13T11:27:53,50,6458595,2021-01-13T11:27:53,500,12130,b16811ed-d48e-48d2-8756-ac33e7b89e46,Marie Curie,50,207994,50,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2021-01-14T06:59:34Z

Having endured the set back of COVID 19 postponing the original 2020 date for the Tokyo Olympic games, Frazer now has his eyes and mind firmly set on the rescheduled date and opening ceremony of July 24th 2021. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">It became clear through this successful partnership that Joshua Payne (3Spires MD) and Frazer Clarke both shared further common goals and passionate personal interests in the<br/>Environment and how best to tackle the impending threat of climate change.

From a personal aspect, my first daughter is due April 2021 and I'm incredibly passionate about ensuring her children have sustainable futures through the lessons we currently set in the present. What extraordinary story 3Spires &amp; Frazer have, and the perfect platform to promote environmental change through the Olympics and<br/>beyond. “</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Frazer Clarke said</b> “When 3Spires approached me on how we can<br/>partner to promote such a key message there was no hesitation. The irony was that I’ve been self-educating for some time on how to personally decrease my family’s environmental footprint having been inspired by some of David Attenborough’s incredible documentaries. I have a baby boy due in June 2021 &amp; along with his big sister Mila, and my future grandchildren I feel that I have a fantastic platform in the Olympic Games and my professional career ahead of me to transmit a message that resonates with my local community and fans internationally.

OVER 12 MILLION CHILDREN IN YEMEN WERE ALREADY IN DANGER FROM WAR, DISEASE AND HUNGER. NOW CORONAVIRUS THREATENS THEIR LITTLE LIVES TOO!

We would like to raise money for Unicef's Yemen Crisis Appeal, just £33 provides a child with food for 3 weeks!

🚶‍♂️Our aim is to collectively (as a team along with our clients) travel the distance from Bedford to Yemen which is 3670 miles by 1st March and raise £5000 along the way!

🚴‍♀️This will be done by walking, running, cycling, rowing or skiing, you name it! on a daily basis! Every little helps here, every mile counts! 

Not only is it a great cause to be involved in but we also feel it provides us all with something positive to focus on, accountability, community and a reason to be as active as possible during this challenging time we find ourselves in!

Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure. Your details are safe with JustGiving - they'll never sell them on or send unwanted emails. Once you donate, they'll send your money directly to the charity. So it's the most efficient way to donate - saving time and cutting costs for the charity.

We cannot thank you enough for your kind donation!!

When I am older I would love to volunteer and travel out to countries in need to help in whatever way I can. For now though, running and raising money through both (hopefully) sponsorship and also doing jobs such as cleaning, car washing, gardening and dog walking, also bake sales and garage sales is probably the most helpful thing I can do to raise money. I am very very excited to run and am very motivated to do this.
